P-values are a convenient tool for making inferences when we don't have the resources to collect giant samples, but with big data, it makes more sense to estimate effect sizes to get an idea of how much something matters rather than using a p-value to decide whether something matters. 

Perhaps not absolutely everything you throw into a model would come out as significant, but with enough data, pretty much anything you could reasonably imagine to affect your outcome variable would.

"Ending misuse of p < 0.05 wouldn't entail valuing p > 0.05. There's no reason to desire a larger type II error rate (chance of rejecting the null when you shouldn't have).

I don't know every case against significance testing, but the cases I've heard against it are incidental or involve machine learning and distance measures being better:

1. 0.05 still leaves 5% chance of rejecting the null in error. That's not 0%, so someone could always beg for more research, and now the implementation of your conclusions is put on hold.
2. Null hypothesis rejection is really complicated, and many people without the training can misapply it. If you're tracking multiple KPIs, you have to adjust your alpha (and the adjustment rule is just a rule of thumb). If you ""peek"" while the experiment is running, you have to adjust your alpha. Easy for novices to miss those.
3. Hypothesis testing relies on assumptions that can't easily be verified in reality. Especially when the variables you're testing are continuous. You have to assume the population you're studying follows a normal distribution. That's called into question sort of like how ""Homo Oeconomicus"" is called into question in the Economics space. I think binomial variables are a little safer to test for significance, on the other hand. You can derive variance for those rather than having to measure or assume it.

"I would argue this depends on what kind of function the analyst has at a company. Like data scientist, the title ""analyst"" holds responsibilities ranging from analyzing processes to regression analysis and time series forecasting.

So really, it depends on whether or not you want a more stats heavy analyst job. GENERALLY though I would argue you should have at least solid stats fundamentals so you're not constrained in your career options.

Know how to explain and practically apply/avoid things like p hacking, sampling bias, regression analysis, significance levels, etc. at almost ELI5 level (i.e. to non stats colleagues).

And ofc make sure your data viz, professional writing, Excel, SQL, and hopefully Python/R is solid.

If it's going to be your first analyst job, be able to explain and basically apply concepts (a portfolio would be great for this) and then once you get the job, be willing to learn.

"I guess it has been where I work, in biotech. There are very few people who work on raw images directly and typically they are domain expert PhDs on the research end. The vast majority of the business is still tabular data, basically clinical data or omics microarray data. 

The metabolomics or proteomics stuff does get extracted from a signal/image but those pipelines are pretty established and the actual data analysis ends up being on boring tabular data. 

But even on this sub in other industries it seems most DSs are working on tabular data (and if its not tabular data then its often some other title)


It depends on what one defines as stats too, I would put  coming up with a loss function and regularizer as statistics but to others stats= hypothesis testing and inference only.

"I disagree. It's the same tired argument like biology is just chemistry, chemistry is just physics, physics is just math etc. Just because there are elements of stats in DL doesn't mean the field of DL is a form of statistics. Why haven't we seen any breakthroughs in NLP/CV from statisticians? Most wouldn't even know where to start. DL makes hardly any of the assumptions required for statistical inference and prediction, which would violate its use for most problems in the statistical paradigm, yet it regularly outperforms predictions made by statistical models. 

I really like this quora answer from Firdaus Janoos, a senior quant researcher who did his PhD in both Stats and ML. The question was ""how important is statistics to deep learning?""

This is just a snippet of the end of his answer by I implore you to read the answer in full as he makes some excellent points. 

""DL is the triumph of empiricism over theory. Theoreticians quiver in fear at the mention of DL - they dont understand it and it kicks the ass of their best wrought theories. 

This may not be sexy or inspirational or TED-talk-worthy - but most deep learning successes have come from trial and error, computation-at-scale, good-ol elbow grease andwriting code. 

Yes -writing codeis probably the thing that characterises 99% of successful DL ideas. No armchair theorizing here. If you were to ask the guys with the big successes in DL how they did it ... their honest answer would be we stayed up long nights working hard and trying lots of different shit- and because we wrote code. 

However, when anyone says machine/deep learning is a form of statistics   please feel free (obliged) to say BULLSHIT. The person who says this understands neither statistics nor machine learning.""

These are what I call the ""fun"" of calc 1. \n\nIntegrals are, well, integral to understanding a lot of math after Calc 1. Probability especially likes integrating over functions (which is probably the most common data science application of integrals) to find the probability of an event in a sample space. However, there are functions that are easy to integrate, and there are functions that will make you through your book at the wall trying to integrate, and it gets even worse in Calc 2 with trig subs and integration by parts. \n\nRealistically, if you wanted to understand what\'s actually happening with these three topics you could get the gist of it over a weekend: limits describe how the function behaves to that limit, derivatives describe the rate of change of a function, and integrals are the area under the curve of a function. That\'s super simplified, but you get the point. I don\'t have to know every car to be able to explain how an engine uses gas, spark, and air to turn a crankshaft. \n\nIf you want to be able to look at a function and apply all three learning objectives of calc 1, it\'ll probably take a few weeks, if you just want to understand what you can learn from a function (and you\'re driven to figure it out) I\'d bet you could do it in around a week.', ""Most of what is done in calculus classes is solving problems, like different types of intervals.  If you're learning it on your own you could skip a lot of that and focus on the concepts but would still take more than 8 hours I think because you have to do at least some problems yourself and not just watch."", '[deleted]', 'Calculus is a specific application of the Mathmatics branch of Analysis. Analysis concerns itself with the behavior of infinity and particularly infinite sequences.\n\nFor the Calculus concept of ""the Derivative"" of a function, used to give the slope of a tangent to a curve, we take a sequence of points which converge to the point we are calculating a derivative for, in this case x:\n\n    (f(x+h)-f(x))/h\n\nTaking a sequence of values for h which converges to 0 will give the slope of the tangent to the curve f() at x when h reaches infinity.\n\nFortunately, rather than waiting for infinity we can simplify the above equation in many cases. The classic example is f(x)=x^(2). In this case the above equation becomes:\n\n    ((x+h)^2 - x^2) / h =\n    (x^2 + 2hx + h^2 - x^2) / h =\n    (2hx +h^(2)) / h=\n    2x + h\n\nNow we can safely substitute 0 for h and get an answer without having to worry about an undefined arithmetic operation. The derivative of x^2 is in fact 2x.\n\nNow you theoretically know calculus. You can use this method to derive all the common computational results of calculus. Unless you are in a real-world engineering domain of some kind (computer vision counts, but I mean like building bridges mainly) you probably will only really need to work with polynomial expressions and not worry about trigonometry too much.\n\nDo you actually know calculus now? Eh. You definitely don\'t have the muscle memory developed by working problem sets or seeing example sets worked by the professor for 100 minutes per week for a year.\n\nAs an exercise, consider deriving the derivative using the above method for the following functions:\n\n    x^2 + 2\n    x^2 + x\n\nAnd watch more videos and instructionals. If you can get the derivative you get the important part for understanding Gradient Descent in ML (well, this and realizing that when a curve bottoms out there must be a spot where the derivative is 0, same goes for when a curve tops out though). Integrals are important for understanding statistics at a higher level. The area under a curve (the integral) is used to define probabilities from a curved probability density function, like the Bell Curve. That said, this is kinda high-level and I have not had to use understanding of integrals the way I have frequently used derivatives in optimization problems of various kinds.']"

This is the definition of dumb, the fact that Fisher was an eugenicist is irrelevant, lets not even get into the fact that when we say eugenics here it probably doesn't mean what you think it does.

From this Nature [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41437-020-00394-6):

In addition, Fishers discussion of the consequences of race mixture in humans (Fisher 1930a, pp 238239) dispels any notion that he was a racist in the Nazi and white supremacist sense of believing in the importance of racial purity.

Fisher believed people with congenital diseases should be offered **voluntary** sterilization, if you want to argue that this is immoral that's another topic and I would likely agree with you (even though the voluntary part makes it a bit gray), but trying to portray Fisher as if he was Josef Mengele is dumb.

Let's not forget that another founding member of this Eugenics society was none other than Keynes, should we discard all of his contributions to economy due to that? That's gonna be a hard pill to swallow, considering Keynesianism is the basis for social democracy.

"So I'll say something contentious. As someone who has worked as a data engineer, a bi dev, a data management consultant, as both a data and a solution architect, and a data quality specialist - good data quality cannot be achieved through technological solutions. By this I mean that you cannot programmatically clean data to solve DQ issues. This is because it treats the symptom and not the underlying root cause. All DQ issues are a result of non-adherence to processes, by either people or systems. For example - people may be dishonest to improve their stats, or may make errors unintentionally such as typos, or systems may be setup to have text fields holding dates, etc etc. Unless the root cause is identified and resolved, you are merely treating a symptom rather than curing the disease. 

I'll happily take the argument that you might need both, especially due to budgetary constraints or pragmatism. But - engagement with a business about the quality of their data, and increasing their maturity rather than giving them plasters, will ultimately enable data science and analytics far further in the long run. It will further ensure informed decisions are made, thus achieving business goals.

Fourier transform to get the power spectrum?,"['That was part of what i did when i was exploring it, but its not that simple unfortunately.  You can get a frequency representation of the data, but if you try to make the assumption that a dft is continuous and use it to represent future data it often wont hold up in the real world.\n\nIts representing the whole signal as a periodic function, which is cool and useful, but what i need is to find which parts of a signal are periodic and which parts can be, but should not be; represented with a periodic function.\n\nFor example, look at the graph of x+sin(x).  It can be approximated with dft, however that representation is flawed because it will be representing it as a sum of multiple periodic functions.  But as the ones who designed the basis function we know that is not the case.\n\nSo what i really want to know is if there is a way to test the validity of fourier components, or otherwise detect the presence of non periodic components mixed with periodic ones.']"

So:**\n\n**TL;DR: Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell suggests that above a threshold, added intelligence doesnt correlate to success. He argues that oddball questions like list all of the possible uses of a large rock do a better job of finding applicants with the skills important for professional success than SAT style questions. I think your little test falls into this oddball category.**\n\nI recently read Outliers by Malcom Gladwell and he talks about how intelligence doesnt necessarily correlate to success. Above a certain point, having a higher IQ doesnt translate to higher probability of professional success. He cites many examples, most notably showing that lesser quality applicants admitted to Ivy League law school due to affirmative action have the same probability of success after law school as higher quality applicants (ie. smarter, higher IQ, better test scores/gpa, etc). \n\nThere is also another famous study that I cant remember the name where a guy went searching for the smartest kids in elementary school. He then followed these geniuses and even helped them get into good schools are get opportunities not available to their dumber counterparts. He was convinced these kids would be the next Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, presidents and CEOs. The result? Nothing special. A few were above average success, a few below. No statistically significant findings - years later someone proved that he would have had the same level of successful people if he had selected kids at random. \n\nNow, this is obviously different as in an interview you arent giving them an IQ test. But I think there is a connection between the standard interview questions and the relative smartness of the applicant. Standard coding questions arent unlike IQ tests or the SATs. \n\nGladwell argues that questions like please list out all possible uses of a large rock are a better indicator of the skills necessary for success, compared to more general SAT style questions. You get more insight into not only the way an applicants mind works, but also his imagination, whether he is funny, etc. \n\nSince knowledge and IQ becomes largely irrelevant after a certain level, rather than selecting the smartest applicant, we should really be using some other filtering mechanism. Gladwell makes a good case for how oddball questions may fit that need. \n\nI think your little test falls into this oddball category, and therefore does more to test the capabilities of an applicant than does write a program that returns only prime numbers given a string of numbers. \n\nIm not really sure why I decided to go off on this tangent, but I personally really liked your tactic and found your thought process as to why it works to be very clever and interesting. I thought Id explain, albeit at a high level and without firm sources, why I think science and the statistics of success seem to backup your style of thinking.']"

**Quote**

>There is a striking phonetic similarity between big data technology and pokemon names. Can you create a service that generates strings that sound like potential pokemon names? And what might be the simplest possible way to make that into a service? Also, would it be possible to generate pokemon names that start with three random characters and end with 'base' (KREBASE, MONBASE would be appropriate but IEYBASE would not be).

>Turns out that this is an interesting problem from a ML standpoint and that it is rediculously easy to build in the cloud. In my talk I will explain the ML behind it;

>markov chains
>probibalistic graphs
>rnn/lstm
>bidirectional lstm

Perfection is the enemy of good enough.', 'Im relatively new to programmingonly about 3-4 years. I can see how this would be a normal thing to do though, as skills progress and your style matures.']"
"It's why Python gets so much flak from devs haha. I love the language and it's not as bad as the hate it gets when you apply good coding practices, but I also see how it lets people be extremely lazy with their intentions

"It's a very uninformative warning that usually references the wrong line of code, but it does often mean you did something wrong earlier.

And by you, I mean me. I still have a couple of them in a rather complex data pipeline that I've yet to track down, but it's not causing any problems so I'm not concerned. Other times, though, it has genuinely alerted me to a problem, even if it told me very little about where the problem actually was.","["">  it does often mean you did something wrong earlier.\n\nPople hate it because it's common for it to be raised spuriously in normal EDA/exploration code. Like: \n\n\n    df = read_csv(...)\n   \n    # Slice out interesting data\n    df = df[...]  # df is now a 'copy' of itself\n    \n    # Normalize a col\n    df[col] = df[col] / 100  # Raises spurious warning""]"
"That one happens when you try to alter data on a view. It's most common when you slice the dataframe (which creates a view) and continue to use and alter the view later in your code. The warning does tell you the right thing to do but it may not correctly tell you where to make the change. There will always be a way to put a .copy() in the right place (usually earlier on before you hit the warning) or a cleaner way to alter values in your dataframe to avoid SettingWithCopyWarning.

It's still annoying since you have to learn a bit more about how pandas works to consistently avoid it.","[""pandas is quirky but I've found it's better to address their warnings for code cleanliness. I see the ignorewarnings in notebooks I've inherited. If I'm using a newer pandas version I either get a red wall of even more warnings or the code breaks completely (ideally they would have a requirements file but that's a different point)\n\nAnd to your point, yeah, once you learn where to apply the .copy(), you should pretty much never get that warning""]"
"Faster, less stupidly verbose syntax, embarassingly parallel. Pretty much an upgrade in every way.","['Yep, it just makes sense. \nWith pandas i was constantly looking up stuff, with polars im often able to guess how things work.']"

"I created a four-page Data Science Cheatsheet to assist with exam reviews, interview prep, and anything in-between","Hey guys, Ive been doing a lot of preparation for interviews lately, and thought Id compile a document of theories, algorithms, and models I found helpful during this time. Originally, I was just keeping notes in a Google Doc, but figured I could create something more permanent and aesthetic.

It covers topics (some more in-depth than others), such as:

* Distributions
* Linear and Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees and Random Forest
* SVM
* KNN
* Clustering
* Boosting
* Dimension Reduction (PCA, LDA, Factor Analysis)
* NLP
* Neural Networks
* Recommender Systems
* Reinforcement Learning
* Anomaly Detection

The four-page Data Science Cheatsheet can be found [here](https://github.com/aaronwangy/Data-Science-Cheatsheet/blob/main/Data_Science_Cheatsheet.pdf), and I hope it's helpful to those looking to review or brush up on machine learning concepts.

I am in no way an expert but I have been very successful in my role. I am the first Data Scientist at my company and we have had 4 others added in the last year due to me being run thin and the demand on my time increasing. I work in the finance industry so we have a lot of data (I would say 1000 tables is a VERY conservative estimate). I think this is is all pretty unique and there are still a lot of things that I am learning so take what I say with a grain of salt.\n\n>So its less about science and more about connections and building trust?\n\nThat has been my experience. The most successful project I was on made a \\~50% reduction in turnaround time across all process in the company. I stumbled on the problem because of a logistic model I ran. When started diving into the issue, a SME said \'this is so beautiful I want to vomit\' because of how much money/effort/etc was wasted. I then spent 3 months trying to better understand the data surrounding the processes, issues that cropped up, and other things we could take action on. To help implement the change, the SME that started the project with me worked probably 60+ hours a week and got promoted to better lead it. The change resulted in less man hour cost, higher win rate for new clients, and around $3m a year in client retention because of the faster turn around times. I didnt know for 2 years but the SME had put really everything into this change. I knew he worked a lot but I didnt know he pushed for this to be his only project (he would live or die by it) and actually changed the culture of those employees impacted by the change to see it\'s success. He made fun instructional videos, he made screen savers on computers, he did everything. He did this to see it\'s success because he believed in it in the project and the direction I gave.\n\nI am extremely confident that I could never implement the project as well as he did (and possibly not even well enough to see 1/4 of the gains we currently have) and am very grateful to have been able to work with him, as I am sure he is grateful to work with me...\n\n>What if the management is not ready to take the blame?\n\nWhat do you mean? In my world, projects are known as failed or successful. Someone is blamed and unless I gave poor direction (I should be blamed), it is often the project lead for their inability to take action. They are in charge of finding a good direction, pushing the change out, and getting people energized about the change. We are a tool they can use to find a direction, continuously track it\'s success (so they can stop a complete failure), or do experiments to see how best to push the change... but in the end of the day, we are just a single tool in their tool kit. \n\nTo sort of curb the likelihood of having giving poor direction, I think that it is beneficial for people new in their role to work extra hours to make sure that their projects don\'t fail and show they can be trusted on future work.\n\n>What else can we do to tackle the sink?\n\nI dont know if it is our responsibility. Your role is to provide as much guidance as possible.

If you are a PhD student, your stipend is set by the grants you obtain or the positions you work. While some grants provide more funding than others, they fall within a narrow range. The NSF GRFP is one of the better paying individual grants you can get at 34,000 per year (it's also very prestigious). Compensation for positions is standardized for a department so if you teach or work in a research lab, there's very little variation in pay. Working in computer science may get them a couple grand more per year when compared to working in a social science lab but the difference is slight.

"A quick intro about me, I am 4 years outside of school and I have stayed at my first company. I have never gotten less than a 20% annual raise. I am in no way an expert but I have been very successful in my role. I am the first Data Scientist at my company and we have had 4 others added in the last year due to me being run thin and the demand on my time increasing. I work in the finance industry so we have a lot of data (I would say 1000 tables is a VERY conservative estimate). I think this is is all pretty unique and there are still a lot of things that I am learning so take what I say with a grain of salt.

>So its less about science and more about connections and building trust?

That has been my experience. The most successful project I was on made a \~50% reduction in turnaround time across all process in the company. I stumbled on the problem because of a logistic model I ran. When started diving into the issue, a SME said 'this is so beautiful I want to vomit' because of how much money/effort/etc was wasted. I then spent 3 months trying to better understand the data surrounding the processes, issues that cropped up, and other things we could take action on. To help implement the change, the SME that started the project with me worked probably 60+ hours a week and got promoted to better lead it. The change resulted in less man hour cost, higher win rate for new clients, and around $3m a year in client retention because of the faster turn around times. I didnt know for 2 years but the SME had put really everything into this change. I knew he worked a lot but I didnt know he pushed for this to be his only project (he would live or die by it) and actually changed the culture of those employees impacted by the change to see it's success. He made fun instructional videos, he made screen savers on computers, he did everything. He did this to see it's success because he believed in it in the project and the direction I gave.

I am extremely confident that I could never implement the project as well as he did (and possibly not even well enough to see 1/4 of the gains we currently have) and am very grateful to have been able to work with him, as I am sure he is grateful to work with me...

>What if the management is not ready to take the blame?

What do you mean? In my world, projects are known as failed or successful. Someone is blamed and unless I gave poor direction (I should be blamed), it is often the project lead for their inability to take action. They are in charge of finding a good direction, pushing the change out, and getting people energized about the change. We are a tool they can use to find a direction, continuously track it's success (so they can stop a complete failure), or do experiments to see how best to push the change... but in the end of the day, we are just a single tool in their tool kit. 

To sort of curb the likelihood of having giving poor direction, I think that it is beneficial for people new in their role to work extra hours to make sure that their projects don't fail and show they can be trusted on future work.

>What else can we do to tackle the sink?

I dont know if it is our responsibility. Your role is to provide as much guidance as possible. I think that the project leads are there to do everything they can to see the project succeed.

A graph in computing or mathematics is an object consisting of linked/relational objects as in graph theory. Graph analysis usually refers to the analysis of graph objects using graph theory.

"A lot of great feedback here. The core 3 for me:

a. Leverage personal networks/recruiters over cold applies. Ive almost exclusively been placed rather than hired from a cold apply in my career. Success rate is extremely high for me when working with a recruiter who has a vested interest in placing me.
b. Dont be afraid of a good internship. Pay might not be the glamorous promised starting wage at $100k but you can quickly grow a portfolio and get promoted to a full data science role. My experience tells me its much easier to find a job while employed than unemployed.
c. You might not have a lot of experience, but what you need is a portfolio. When I look at young analyst/data science hires I look for passion for the field.

You may not tick every box and the job may not offer everything you look for, but try to find the best match.\n- tailor your application to the role.\n- try to get in direct contact with the organisation to get a foot in the door.

But there's a fine line between showing interest and being too pushy, so tread carefully. \n\nBasically, sniping the best opportunities always worked well for me. Hiring managers have a good intuition for cookie cutter applications and will be triggered by an application that stands out from the rest. This assumes your application is read in the first place and you're not one in hundred applicants for a position.

"If that makes you feel better, it's fine, but I think this illustrates the struggles you're going through with being rejected.

Imagine you're looking for a plumber: you have kept two ads from two plumbers, Mike and Josh. 

You call them, they both seem good, but Mike was a little more responsive and it felt like he understood your problem better. At the end of the day, you give your business to Mike. Josh calls back to followup, you tell him that you went with someone else. He was really nice about it, and told you 'good luck'. 

Now imagine 6 months later you have another issue. Mike is on vacation, so you call Josh and throw business his way this time. 

Perfect, the two plumbers have made some business. 

Now imagine that Josh had said 'Oh you're not hiring me? Then please don't call again, lose my number, and throw away any prospectus I might have sent to your house.

They *should* be able to feasibly provide guidance on data management, storage, ETL, model building, pipeline building, model training, model production/lifetime cycles, hypothesis development/testing, and some applied business analysis (specific to the domain). They don't need to be experts in all of them by any means, and it's unrealistic to think that they would be an expert in all of those things. But a *Data Scientist* should be able to cast a pretty **wide net** and know the ins and outs of the critical elements: how to store it, transform it, clean it, analyze it, use it, maintain it,.\n\nIt's not to say that a Data Analyst **can't** do those things it's not like medicine and licensure prevents it, but data analysis is a much more narrow scope. I would not expect a data analyst to be mucking around in ETL or pipeline building nor participate in (most) data management discussions. I also wouldn't expect them to be experts in production model lifecycle management. If we're talking about classic statistical data analysts, I also would more heavily emphasize knowledge of things like regressions, chi\\^2, etc... core quant and qual analytics foundations - and to be fair, I would *not* expect them to know how to build, train, and run neural networks. Analysts aren't software engineers, so if they are doing a lot of ML or pipeline development, I would surmise that they are working outside of their scope - this could be that they are trying to break out of an analysts role, which is all well and good, but it could also be that their employer is taking advantage of them and is giving them work that is more wide spread than what they should be doing as an analyst. They should be focused on Data Analysis, not all of the other stuff in the pipeline.\n\nThis also means that data analysts are specialists of sorts. Back to my analogy, a physician *could* do a nurses job, but I can almost guarantee that they *wouldn't* do it as well as an experienced nurse would... and ignoring licensing (and nurse practitioners) a nurse *could learn to* do a physicians job, but that would be wildly inappropriate, that is asking a nurse to take on way more responsibility than they *should* be taking on and paying them a *fraction* of what they would be making as a primary care provider. I like the analogy because if an employer were asking their nurses to function this way, it would be 100% evident that they were taking advantage of them to work beyond their scope so that they didn't need to pay for appropriate salaried employees.

A p-value is the probability of getting a result as or more extreme as your data under the conditions of the null hypothesis. Essentially you are saying, ""if the null hypothesis is true and is actually what\'s going on, how strange is my data?"" If your data is pretty consistent with the situation under the null hypothesis, then you get a larger p-value because that reflects that the probability of your situation occurring is quite high. If your data is not consistent with the situation under the null hypothesis, then you get a smaller p-value because that reflects that the probability of your situation occurring is quite low.\n\nWhat to do with the information you get from your p-value is a whole topic of debate. This is where alpha level, Type I error rate, significance, etc. show up. How do you use your p-value to decide what to do? In most of the non-stats world, you compare it to some significance level and use that to decide whether to accept the null hypothesis or reject it in favor of the alternative hypothesis (which is you saying that you have concluded that the alternative hypothesis is a better explanation for your data than the null hypothesis, not that the alternative hypothesis is correct). The significance level is arbitrary. If you think about setting your significance level to be 0.5, then you reject the null hypothesis when your p-value is 0.49 and accept it when your p-value is 0.51. But that\'s a very small difference in those p-values. You had to make the cut-off somewhere, so you end up with these types of splits.\n\nKeep in mind that you actually *didn\'t* have to make the cut-off somewhere. Non-statisticians want a quick and easy way to make a decision so they\'ve gone crazy with significance levels (especially 0.05) but p-values are not decision making tools. They\'re being used incorrectly.\n\nMost people fundamentally misunderstand what a p-value measures and they thinks it\'s P(H0|Data) when it\'s actually P(Data|H0).\n\n(Note that this is the definition of a frequentist p-value and not a Bayesian p-value.)\n\nEdit: sorry, forgot to answer your actual question.\n\n> get a p-value of 0.1\n\nA p-value of 0.1 means that if you ran your experiment perfectly 1000 times and you satisfied all of the conditions of the statistical test perfectly each of the 1000 times then if the null hypothesis is what\'s really going on, you would get results as strange or stranger than your about 100 every 1000 experiments. Is this situation unusual enough that you end up deciding to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis? A lot of people will say that a p-value of 0.1 isn\'t small enough because getting your results about 10% of the time under the conditions of the null hypothesis isn\'t enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis as an explanation.', ""The answer is simple: It's the probability getting such results (or more extreme ones) under the null hypothesis."", 'Ok, I see what you mean.  I thought you would want me to start talking about ""infinate numbers of hypothtical replications"" and the sort.

So basically, higher this value, more is the probability that it occurred just by chance. If you look at the flipside now, the lower this value is, the lower the probability that that event/situation occurred by chance, which means you can say, with certain confidence, that X caused Y if you get my drift.\n\nFor eg: \nYou have yearly Data of sales of a local rainwear store. The store owner tells you that sales increases during the monsoon as opposed to others. This will be your null hypothesis. \n\nThen you set your significance level (this decides whether the p value is significant or not). Most commonly used significance level is 95%. \nI'll use this for this example. \n\nInterpretation:\n\nLets consider that whatever analysis you do gives you a p-value of 0.1. Significance threshold is 100%-95%= 5% or 0.05. Now 0.05 < 0.1, thus the causation et al being checked is not significant / most probably occurred by chance. In plain terms, the monsoon does NOT drive sales at this store. \n\nIf the p value is lower than 0.05 in this example, then it most probably did NOT occur by chance. In plain terms, we can say that sales increases during the monsoon.\n\nTLDR: At a predetermined significance level, we can use the p-value from our analysis to ascertain if the causation we're testing occurred by chance or not depending on whether it's more or less than the p-value  derived from the significance threshold.""]"

If your data is pretty consistent with the situation under the null hypothesis, then you get a larger p-value because that reflects that the probability of your situation occurring is quite high. If your data is not consistent with the situation under the null hypothesis, then you get a smaller p-value because that reflects that the probability of your situation occurring is quite low.

What to do with the information you get from your p-value is a whole topic of debate. This is where alpha level, Type I error rate, significance, etc. show up. How do you use your p-value to decide what to do? In most of the non-stats world, you compare it to some significance level and use that to decide whether to accept the null hypothesis or reject it in favor of the alternative hypothesis (which is you saying that you have concluded that the alternative hypothesis is a better explanation for your data than the null hypothesis, not that the alternative hypothesis is correct). The significance level is arbitrary. If you think about setting your significance level to be 0.5, then you reject the null hypothesis when your p-value is 0.49 and accept it when your p-value is 0.51. But that's a very small difference in those p-values. You had to make the cut-off somewhere, so you end up with these types of splits.

Keep in mind that you actually *didn't* have to make the cut-off somewhere. Non-statisticians want a quick and easy way to make a decision so they've gone crazy with significance levels (especially 0.05) but p-values are not decision making tools. They're being used incorrectly.

Most people fundamentally misunderstand what a p-value measures and they thinks it's P(H0|Data) when it's actually P(Data|H0).

(Note that this is the definition of a frequentist p-value and not a Bayesian p-value.)

Edit: sorry, forgot to answer your actual question.

> get a p-value of 0.1

A p-value of 0.1 means that if you ran your experiment perfectly 1000 times and you satisfied all of the conditions of the statistical test perfectly each of the 1000 times then if the null hypothesis is what's really going on, you would get results as strange or stranger than your about 100 every 1000 experiments. Is this situation unusual enough that you end up deciding to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis? A lot of people will say that a p-value of 0.1 isn't small enough because getting your results about 10% of the time under the conditions of the null hypothesis isn't enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis as an explanation.","[""This is exactly the sort of response I'd want a candidate to be able to provide.

"The p-value is basically the probability of something (event/situation) having occurred by random chance. So basically, higher this value, more is the probability that it occurred just by chance. If you look at the flipside now, the lower this value is, the lower the probability that that event/situation occurred by chance, which means you can say, with certain confidence, that X caused Y if you get my drift.

For eg: 
You have yearly Data of sales of a local rainwear store. The store owner tells you that sales increases during the monsoon as opposed to others. This will be your null hypothesis. 

Then you set your significance level (this decides whether the p value is significant or not). Most commonly used significance level is 95%. 
I'll use this for this example. 

Interpretation:

Lets consider that whatever analysis you do gives you a p-value of 0.1. Significance threshold is 100%-95%= 5% or 0.05. Now 0.05 < 0.1, thus the causation et al being checked is not significant / most probably occurred by chance. In plain terms, the monsoon does NOT drive sales at this store. 

If the p value is lower than 0.05 in this example, then it most probably did NOT occur by chance. In plain terms, we can say that sales increases during the monsoon.

TLDR: At a predetermined significance level, we can use the p-value from our analysis to ascertain if the causation we're testing occurred by chance or not depending on whether it's more or less than the p-value  derived from the significance threshold.","['this is just wrong from the first sentence onwards\n\n> Now 0.05 < 0.1, thus the causation et al being checked is not significant / most probably occurred by chance.\n\nthis is like instant interview fail territory', ""Under frequentist assumptions that work really well for ball bearings and beer, but less well in complex human systems. \n\nP-value is an easy question to evaluate because there are very clear ways to calculate and interpret it correctly and very clear ways to calculate and interpret incorrectly. But it's really most useful in highly controlled environments like clinical trials. When I discuss p-values with staff (not in an interview), I'm more interested in what meaning can be attached to their null hypothesis and whether they've really got a dataset that is conducive to only one, actionable alternate hypothesis.\n\nIn uncontrolled, unplanned data collected from a group of humans, almost nothing is truly random. To use an engineering analogy, the problem with human generated data isn't signal-to-noise ratio, it's interference from other signals that you don't happen to be interested in at the moment.""]"
"In empirical research you can't prove anything. You can only gather more evidence. In academia the threshold for ""hmm, you might be onto something, let's print it and see what others think"" is 5% in social sciences and 5 sigma (so waaaay less than 5%) in particle physics with most other science falling somewhere in between.

It doesn't **mean** anything except that it's an interesting enough of a result to write it down and share it with others.

It takes a meta-analysis of dozens of experiments and multiple repeated studies in different situations using different methods to actually accept it as a scientific fact. And this does not involve p-values.","[""In most biology we also stick to 0.05. But we *also* tend to require orthogonal approaches to the same question and a handful of other experiments that get at the same idea.\n\nSo, yeah, 0.05 is the threshold, but really it's the congruence of a (often rather large) set of experiments.""]"

"> threshold can be arbitrary

This is the problem.  If you have no grounding from which to derive a non-arbitrary threshold, then p-values are absolutely uninformative.  Put another way, p-values are not universally applicable.","['> no grounding from which to derive a non-arbitrary threshold\n\nThere\'s lots of ways to derive a non-arbitrary threshold. The obvious one is that you\'re okay with a 5% chance of making the wrong decision, in which case an alpha level of 5% makes sense. This is not how most people use significance levels and they do just arbitrarily use 5% because that\'s what they\'ve been told to do, even if it doesn\'t make sense in their situation. Just because people are using things incorrectly doesn\'t mean that they\'re useless.\n\n> p-values are absolutely uninformative\n\nP-values are informative by definition.

"What do you need p-values for?

This type of experimentation cares about practical significance. P-values are about statistical significance.

You say ""blindly collecting data"". I am 100% sure you're not talking about experiments. You're talking about optimizing against some type of objective but you don't know much about optimization so you default to stats 101 and think ""experiments, hypothesis, p-value"".

Typical XY problem. You focus on the wrong solution to your actual problem.

P-values are just one aspect of the consideration of how well something works. For a statistical test where you want to judge your individual results in a stochastic environment, they can be useful. In other areas like the evaluation of how well models are working, they may not be useful.

These days our ""enormous data sets!!!"" are hilarious (like 600,000+ SNPs across 5,000 or 10,000 samples) but I ended up working out how to do data transfer, storage, and analysis for studies in collaboration with labs at a bunch of academic and medical institutions mostly in the UK and US but also in several European countries because we had no other option.\n\nWhat we now call ""data science"" has been around for a lot longer than people realize.

"What kind of a business has 2 products that they compare once and that's it? Sure it's the situation in academia because then the research is over and you write a paper.

Out in the real world things are different. You never really care if there is a statistically significant difference between 2 products. You care about picking the best one. Optimizing for the best option isn't really solvable with p-values. This is a textbook optimization problem, not a hypothesis testing problem.

This is precisely my point. People with ""statistics for social science"" or an undergrad in stats think that stuff they learned that was specifically tailored for academic research (or clinical research) is directly applicable out in the real world.

My R2 score was around 0.3 (which is not inherently bad from what I'm reading) but it predicted a higher price to a 2 room apartment than the price avarege of 3 room apartments, so that doesn't seem good to me.

Do these models work with the problem I described? And also, how much should I try to learn about each before trying to implement them?","['If you\'re going to implement a model you should really learn about it first. At the very least a good qualitative understanding of what\'s going on in the guts of each one, what assumptions it\'s making, and what its output actually means. For example, you don\'t need to be able to code a GAM from scratch to be effective, but you really should know what ""basis function expansion"" and ""penalised likelihood"" mean and how they\'re used before calling `fit_transform()`\n\nProbably worth trying a GLM tbh. See if you can work out in advance what parameters and predictors to choose before just blindly modelling, make sure your choices are based both on the theory and on what your data viz is hinting at', ""No modeling advice specifically for you since I'm pretty new to the game as well, but I wouldn't doubt a model just because it prices a 2br higher than the average for a 3br. These models are based on things that humans want. If a 2br has better features than most, yeah it's gonna out price an avg 3br. This was a common example in one of my classes (except for houses), that as bedrooms increase, the variability in price increases substantially, so just plotting br against price, showed a fan shape (indicating a log transformation might be beneficial). The thought being that if you have an 800 sqft apartment with 2 bedrooms, and an 800 sqft apartment with 3 bedrooms, those bedrooms are gonna be tiny and it's gonna be cramped. Hard to say why exactly without knowing the variables, but it could be coded in one of the variables somewhere that indicates those kinds of things.""]"

"So this article has a bunch of suggestions on how to fix it: [https://windowsreport.com/err-connection-refused-windows-10/](https://windowsreport.com/err-connection-refused-windows-10/)

I think a lot of the problem is the windows firewall so turning it off might work (although that might be overkill).  There should be a way to allow python processes through.  You don't want to allow a specific port through (although if you go that route 40000 is the best choice) because if you run multiple notebooks each with a different D-Tale instance they will be on different ports.

Unfortunately I mainly develop on linux so I don't hit these issues. But i'm going to take some time next week to setup an environment on windows so I can be a little more helpful with these issues. Sorry :(

Here's another article on how to allow python processes through the firewall: [https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/uncategorized/how-to-create-exceptions-in-windows-vista-firewall/](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/uncategorized/how-to-create-exceptions-in-windows-vista-firewall/)",['Thanks.

"Some applied approaches are deeply rooted in statistics, such as Bayesian techniques (ie. naive Bayes), mixture models, and K means. Deep learning, linear models, and some clustering approaches depend on optimization, landing it in the field of numerical optimization or operational research (or the thousand variants thereof). That is, you justify the effectiveness of optimization-based approaches via arguments about convexity or global optimal, not based on statistics. For example, gradient descent and Newtonian methods are based on calculus. While SGD and variance-reduction techniques do require statistical tools, the end goal is reducing the convergence rate in the convex case, leading to these techniques landing squarely in optimization with some real analysis or calculus (take your pick). While statistical arguments are sometimes used in machine learning theory, especially as it relates to average case analysis or making stronger results by applying assumptions of data (eg. that it emerges from a Gaussian process), there are a lot of results that don't come from the statistical domain. For example, many optimization approaches use linear algebra (eg. PCA and linear regression use the QR matrix decomposition for the asymptotically fastest SVD).

Statistical learning theory is a foundational approach to understanding bounds and the effects of ML, but computational learning theory (CLT, sometimes referred to as machine learning theory) approaches machine learning from a multifaceted approach. For example, VC dimension and epsilon nets. You could argue that the calculations necessary for this are reminiscent of probability, but it's equally valid to use combinatorial arguments, especially since they sit close to set theory.

What I'm trying to say here is that statistics are sometimes a tool, sometimes analysis, but it *isn't* the end-all be-all of machine learning. Machine learning, like every field that came before it, depends on insights from other fields, until it became enough to be a field in its own right. Statistics depends on probability, set theory, combinatorics, optimization, calculus, linear algebra, and so forth, just as much as machine learning. So, it's really silly to say that all of these are just statistics.","["">Deep learning, linear models, and some clustering approaches depend on optimization, landing it in the field of numerical optimization or operational research (or the thousand variants thereof).

Mathematical modeling describes the process of getting a model that somewhat represents something that we want to model. Unlike other models, mathematical models are equations or something like that (a map or a globe is a model of the world but it's not a mathematical model). Statistical models are a tiny subset of mathematical models.

If I went ahead and got myself some data and used the data to estimate myself a taxi pricing model, sure that's statistical. But if I don't use data to come up with my model (such as eyeballing it and then seeing if it works or having a crystal ball whisper it to me in my dreams) then it is not a statistical model.

Whether it's a linear model in the format wx + b or it's a neural network or a decision tree or a random forest doesn't matter.

Statistical modeling refers to what you're doing, not the mathematical techniques themselves. Most of those techniques have nothing to do with statistics and are found all over the place.

Most of those techniques boil down to calculus and linear algebra. Statistics doesn't have some special claim on calculus and linear algebra. Pretty much everything you compute will involve linear algebra.

You probably went to school and noticed that this sign right here = means ""equals to"". Maybe in the future you will go to college to study some math and encounter arrows and do some proofs and realize that you can represent the exact same thing in multiple ways and solve the exact same problem using multiple techniques.


You are clearly some clueless undergrad or a highschooler with no mathematical training.",['Im a statistics and physics PhD student lol and I have not once tried to claim every single mode under the fucking sun is based on statistics??????']
"Wx+b is still statistics. Youre still learning a very simple mapping of y=f(x) (assuming x and y are both real). Youre estimating W and b from N training pairs, and once youve have those you get them estimate y. And if you take a taxi fair * kilometres + charge = y and call it a linear model as you did then you either have plugged in known data to an already trained linear model, or you just have an incredibly shit one because you have n=1 training pairs","[""No it is not statistics. It's god damn multiplication you learn in 3rd grade.\n\nIf I am a taxi driver and I decided that is my pricing model than that is my pricing model.

When you teach a semester long class to students, you teach from the bottom up, ensuring they understand the fundamentals so they can build upon them going forward. 

However, when you give a talk to an audience of non-specialists, in a time-limited setting, you do exactly the opposite: you do top-down, explaining the big picture and only going into details as time and interest dictate.  They'll stop asking questions when they lose interest, but it's your job to anticipate and steer questions until they reach that point, breaking the subject down into progressively more granular pieces until they're satisfied.

My Data Science Manifesto from a Self Taught Data Scientist,"**Background**

Im a self-taught data scientist, with about 5 years of data analyst experience and now about 5 years as a Data Scientist. Im more math minded than the average person, but Im not special. I have a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering, and have worked alongside 6 data scientists, 4 of which have PHDs and the other 2 have a masters. Despite being probably, the 6th out of 7 in natural ability, I have been the 2nd most productive data scientist out of the group.


**Gatekeeping**

Every day someone on this subreddit asks some derivative of what do I need to know to get started in ML/DS? The answers are always smug and give some insane list of courses and topics one must master. As someone whos been on both sides, this is attitude extremely annoying and rampart in the industry. I dont think you can be bad at math and have no pre-requisite knowledge, and be successful, but the levels needed are greatly exaggerated. Most of the people telling you these things are just posturing due to insecurity.



As a mechanical engineering student, I had at least 3 calculus courses, a linear algebra course, and a probability course, but it was 10+ years before I attempted to become a DS, and I didnt remember much at all. This sub, and others like it, made me think I had to be an expert in all these topics and many more to even think about trying to become a data scientist. 



When I started my journey, I would take coding, calculus, stats, linear algebra, etc. courses. Id take a course, do OK in it, and move onto the next thing. However, eventually Id get defeated because I realized I couldnt remember much from the courses I took 3 months prior. It just felt like too much information for me to hold at a single time while working a full-time job. I never got started on actually solving problems because the internet and industry told me I needed to be an expert in all these things.


**What you actually need**

The reality is, 95% of the time you only need a basic understanding of these topics. Projects often require a deeper dive into something else, but that's a case by case basis, and you figure that out as you go.


For calculus, you don't need to know how to integrate multivariable functions by hand. You need to know that derivatives create a function that represents the slope of the original function, and that where the derivative = 0 is a local min/max. You need to know integrals are area under the curve.



For stats, you need to understand what a p value represents. You don't need to know all the different tests, and when to use them. You need to know that they exist and why you need them. When it's time to use one, just google it, and figure out which one best suits your use case.



For linear algebra, you don't need to know how to solve for eigenvectors by hand, or whatever other specific things you do in that class. You need to know how to read it. It is also helpful to know properties of linear algebra. Like the cross product of 2 vectors yields a vector perpendicular to both.



For probability, you need to understand basic things, but again, just google your specific problem.



You don't need to be an expert software dev. You need to write ok code, and be able to use chatGPT to help you improve it little by little.



You don't need to know how to build all the algorithms by hand. A general understanding of how they work is enough in 95% of cases.



Of all of those things, the only thing you absolutely NEED to get started is basic coding ability. 



By far the number one technical ability needed to 'master' is understanding how to ""frame"" your problem, and how to test and evaluate and interpret performance. If you can ensure that you're accurately framing the problem and evaluating the model or alogithm, with metrics that correctly align with the use case, that's enough to start providing some real value. I often see people asking things like ""should I do this feature engineering technique for this problem?"" or which of these algorithms will perform best?. The answer should usually be, ""I don't know, try it, measure it, and see"". Understanding how the algorithms work can give you clues into what you should try, but at the end of the day, you should just try it and see.   



Despite the posturing in the industry, very few people are actually experts in all these domains. Some people are better at talking the talk than others, but at the end of the day, you WILL have to constantly research and learn on a project by project basis. Thats what makes it fun and interesting. As you gain PRACTICAL experience, you will grow, you will learn, you will improve beyond what you could've ever imagined. Just get the basics down and get started, don't spin your wheels trying and failing to nail all these disciplines before ever applying anything.



The reason Im near the top in productivity while being near the bottom in natural and technical ability is my 5 years of experience as a data analyst at my company. During this time, I got really good at exploring my companies data. When you are stumped on problem, intelligently visualizing the data often reveals the solution. Ive also had the luxury of analyzing our data from all different perspectives. Id have assignments from marketing, product, tech support, customer service, software, firmware, and other technical teams. I understand the complete company better than the other data scientists. Im also just aware of more tips and tricks than anyone else.  



Good domain knowledge and data exploration skills with average technical skills will outperform good technical skills with average domain knowledge and data exploration almost every time. 


**Advice for those self taught**


Ive been on the hiring side of things a few times now, and the market is certainly difficult. I think it would be very difficult for someone to online course and side project themselves directly into a DS job. The side project would have to be EXTREMELY impressive to be considered. However, I think my path is repeatable.



I taught myself basic SQL and Tableau and completed a few side projects. I accepted a job as a data analyst, in a medium sized (100-200 total employees) on a team where DS and DA shared the same boss. The barrier to DA is likely higher than it was ~10 years ago, but it's definitely something achievable. My advice would be to find roles that you have some sort of unique experience with, and tailor your resume to that connection. No connection is too small. For example, my DA role required working with a lot of accelerometer data. In my previous job as a test engineer, I sometimes helped set up accelerometers to record data from the tests. This experience barely helped me at all when actually on the job, but it helped my resume actually get looked at. For entry level jobs employers are looking for ANY connection, because most entry level resumes all look the same.


The first year or two I excelled at my role as a DA. I made my boss aware that I wanted to become a DS eventually. He started to make me a small part of some DS projects, running queries, building dashboards to track performance and things like that. I was also a part of some of the meetings, so I got some insight into how certain problems were approached. 



My boss made me aware that I would need to teach myself to code and machine learning. My role in the data science projects grew over time, but I was ultimately blocked from becoming a DS because I kept trying and failing to learn to code and the 25 areas of expertise reddit tells you that you need by taking MOOCs. 

  

Eventually, I paid up for DataQuest. I naively thought the course would teach me everything I needed to know. While you will not be proficient in anything DS upon completing, the interactive format made it easy to jump into 30-60 minutes of structured coding every day. Like a real language consistency is vital. 



Once I got to the point where I could do some basic coding, I began my own side project. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. ONCE YOU GET THE BASELINE KNOWLEDGE, JUST GET STARTED WORKING ON THINGS. This is where the real learning began. You'll screw things up, and that's ok. Titanic problem is fine for day 1, but you really need a project of your own. I picked a project that I was interested in and had a function that I would personally use (I'm on V3 of this project and it's grown to a level that I never could've dreamed of at the time). This was crucial in ensuring that I stuck with the project, and had real investment in doing it correctly. When I didnt know how to do something in the project, I would research it and figure it out. This is how it works in the real world.



After 3 months of Dataquest and another 3 of a project (along with 4 years of being a data analyst) I convinced my boss to assign me DS project. I worked alongside another data scientist, but I owned the project, and they were mostly there for guidance, and coded some of the more complex things. I excelled at that project, and was promoted to data scientist, and began getting projects of my own, with less and less oversight. We have a very collaborative work environment, and the data scientists are truly out to help each other. We present our progress to each other often which allows us all to learn and improve. I have been promoted twice since I began DS work.



I'd like to add that you can almost certainly do all this in less time than it took me. I wasted a lot of time spinning my wheels. ChatGPT is also a great resource that could also increase your learning speed. Don't blindly use it, but it's a great resource.


**Tldr:** Sir this is Wendys.

**Edit:** Im not saying to never go deeper into things, Im literally always learning. I go deeper into things all the time. Often in very niche domains, but you don't need to be a master in all things get started or even excel. Be able to understand generalities of those domains, and dig deeper when the problem calls for it. Learning a concept when you have a direct application is much more likely to stick.


I thought it went without saying, but Im not saying those things I listed are literally the only things you need to know about those topics, I was just giving examples of where relatively simple concepts were way more important than specifics.

**Edit #2:** I'm not saying schooling is bad. Yes obviously having a masters and/or PhD is better than not. I'm directing this to those who are working a full time job who want to break into the field, but taking years getting a masters while working full time and going another 50K into debt is unrealistic"
"As a stats professor who teaches DS, your point about evaluation is especially important with the rise in generative models. It was already a challenge getting DS students to think critically about the *practical* performance of their models before LLMs, and now model evaluation more important than ever.

While I agree that you dont need to memorize all the statistical models and tests as long as youre aware of where to find them and how to use them, Ill add that its equally important to know *when* to reach for them. Too many students struggle with recognizing when a problem calls for statistical testing rather than classification. When all you know is ML, everything looks like a prediction problem.

And communication!!! If you cant explain the relevance of your results to laypeople, youre not going to be an effective data scientist.","['Im seeing this more often where tools are thrown at a problem, and recently on LinkedIn, how you can use causal ml. The whole post was about utilizing causal ML models, as if theyd improve your prediction performance. \n\nIts this classification of models that I despise in the data science hype.\n\nI can use a linear model for bother prediction and causality, but they are _different problems_ and require very different framings. \n\nApproach data science domain first, like a scientist.', 'I agree 100%', ""Can you elaborate more on your point regarding testing as opposed to prediction?

I understand the complete company better than the other data scientists""\n\ni.e. the generalist who understand every corner of company']"
"The other big thing you didn't mention is recognizing the importance and different ways to clean and prepare data. Honestly, it shouldn't need to be said, but I just worked under a senior data scientist on a consulting gig that didn't think that step was important at all. I literally facepalmed watching them train a model on a dataset with over 50% null values and duplicates. Understanding the actual meaning and importance behind ""garbage in, garbage out"" should be the absolute bare minimum for any DS","[""That's honestly part of what makes me good at my job, but at least for me, it's somewhat related to domain knowledge too. Bad data at my company is often 'hidden'. A vague example is, don't use data from March because there was a bug in some other part of the company. It's not obvious when just looking at the data that it's wrong, but I just happen to be in a unique position where I understand that a bug in one seemingly unrelated area can percolate through and cause bad data elsewhere.""]"
"Cool story but Im not sure what to make of it.

Your manifestos thesis hints at something among the lines of technical/academic knowledge is not a prerequisite for professional success, which is of course true but its kind of a mute point in terms of actionable recommendations since P(being a good DS | having technical skills) >>> P(being a good DS| not having technical skills). Context and domain knowledge are *much* easier and cheaper to obtain than specialized knowledge in advanced statistics, machine learning or programming. What youre saying is not false or wrong (local to your experience) but I find it hard to generalize or extrapolate practical advice based off them.

I am a lead DS in big tech, Ive interviewed hundreds of people, and have worked and interacted directly with hundreds of others (so theres a large selection bias in my sample towards heavily credentialed individuals) but in my experience, the most truly outstanding individuals are those that have a really large toolkit (solid technical skills), are rigorous thinkers (can handle ambiguous situations and frame them appropriately while recognizing caveats and trade offs), AND have solid domain context or experience that allows them to use the above in an *efficient* way to solve problems.

Yeah, to get a DS gig you dont _need_ a PhD and you can  eventually be pretty decent at your job. I know plenty of DS generalists that add a ton of value to their teams. But 1) it is much harder to put your foot on the door if you dont have a credible skill set and 2) your ceiling is much lower as theres only so much you can do with wits and SQL. I dont think asking for technical proficiency is just about gatekeeping or a conspiracy from data scientists to appear collectively smart, it is just a good predictor of success.

That said, I agree that you dont need to be an expert on every particular tool and technique. If I had to focus on something in particular, it is important to be a SQL wizard and to have solid foundations and a working intuition of statistical inference, probability, research design and statistical learning. Adding hands on knowledge of *any* modern programming language, then youd be in the top 10% of data scientists anywhere.

Sometimes prediction isnt actually necessary.\n\nMy background is bioinformatics, so if we have class labels for disease and healthy, we can either train a classifier, or we can test for which features are different. If were trying to identify biomarkers we can use diagnose new patients, then yes, we want to do prediction. But if we want to *understand* the disease better then it may be more useful to develop statistical models to test which features differ between conditions, so we can decide where to focus research for drug development.\n\nAnd no, using feature importance from a classifier does not accomplish the latter, because you need to control for different sources of variation with an appropriate statistical model.']"

Lots of times, new data scientists will see class labels and go straight into classification mode without considering what the actual domain problem is. Sometimes prediction isnt actually necessary.

My background is bioinformatics, so if we have class labels for disease and healthy, we can either train a classifier, or we can test for which features are different. If were trying to identify biomarkers we can use diagnose new patients, then yes, we want to do prediction. But if we want to *understand* the disease better then it may be more useful to develop statistical models to test which features differ between conditions, so we can decide where to focus research for drug development.

And no, using feature importance from a classifier does not accomplish the latter, because you need to control for different sources of variation with an appropriate statistical model.","['yep, feature importance from classifier is more like the most correlated feature rather than the most causal feature.

Whereas someone with a PHD in physics that has no idea about the domain is far more likely to trust their black-box ML model while having little clue as to how it functions in different types of scenarios.

"When I was hired as a data scientist in the training department at Star Health, this is the list of tasks that were assigned to me:

* Make charts for presentations
* Learn about the Learning Management System (LMS) \[functionalities, content management, etc.\] and help others in the whole company learn how to use it \[tougher than it sounds, most were computer-illiterate\]
* Handle the invoices received from e-learning service providers and follow up with Accounts on whether the invoices were cleared
* Talk with e-learning vendors, specifically bargaining (ugh!)

As if this wasn't enough, next came another excruciatingly disgusting work: the company was building a training academy and the whole training department was to shift there. I had to follow up with the interior designers and the builder about the completion of the work. That's the work of the Administration department, isn't it? I'd often remark to my supportive colleagues that I just didn't paint the place; I seem to have done everything else. The company treated me like a jackass.

The main problem was that they never acknowledged my introversion, English fluency, voracious reading habit, grammatical perfection and my writing ability. I tried my best to articulate to everyone around, but they were far more content in undermining me. The icing on the cake: I was also used for creating calendar invites and hosting Zoom meetings. Exactly what executive assistants should be doing. The irony was that we had a receptionist, but I was still the one doing it.

That was the last straw for me. I had joined in February 2020 and had wanted to leave in July 2020, but the pandemic-induced slowdown meant that there were no jobs available in the market (in India, at least). Besides, I was looking for an opportunity as a content writer rather than as a data science professional (yeah, I finally decided to go mainstream with my passion).

After a year and a half of job hunting, I finally landed one and I happily resigned from Star in January 2022. People at Star were baffled; some of them still call me for clarifications on the LMS and I angrily respond that ""I resigned from your shithole company long back. Stop calling me."" Some of them still assume that I would be at Star forever. The fact that Star Health has people who spend their entire career at one company is a bummer. This ""taken-for-granted"" attitude is what irked me the most.

Thankfully, my current company [https://examroom.ai/](https://examroom.ai/) is heaven. I'm ready to go over and above for them as they differ from my previous employer in critical aspect: they accept me for who I am. They embrace my introversion. They provide flexible timings, which is a boon for writers like me. My advice to you is this: work at a place where you are respected.

I have gotten offers so far from every place I interviewed at and used the smaller offers to ask Amazon to give me a decision earlier, which ended up working. I only did 2 interviews with Amazon before I got my team and offer, which from reading online isn't common as they usually have a 3rd or 4th interview for interns. Its been a long process and a battle at every stage. Just 2 weeks ago I was resigned to the idea of a summer with no internship, but here we are now."
"Congrats on the offer. Amazon is a great first role, you'll learn a lot. I don't know if they still have the program for interns, but try to ask your manager to help you find a mentor. It makes a world of difference. Good luck :)","['Pretty sure Amazon has an internal Mentorship program employees can sign up for!', ""> ask your manager to help you find a mentor.\n\nThis transcends through nearly any career. Having a mentor outside of your direct chain of management is key. I've have several people whom I consider mentors within my company and external to it.

"The most insufferable woman I ever met was a data scientist. I was at a bar in San Francisco known to be a hangout spot for UCSF nurses and doctors. She approaches me at the bar and we start talking but it was immediately odd and confrontational. She flat out asked me  what I thought she did for a living and I guessed nurse practitioner in onco or neuro departments (which UCSF is heavy with). It was a shot in the dark but I figured if I was very specific and correct it would be funny.

She audibly scoffed and I thought I had maybe insulted a physician (which is fair, the nurse/doctor divide is unnecessarily gendered) but instead she acted all incredulous and indignant, called a friend over, and was like this guy thinks Im just a nurse.

After some back and forth about how just a nurse seemed like a more condescending position than assuming someone was a nurse she finally says something like honey, Im a DATA SCIENTIST.

By this point I knew I was going to keep poking the bear. I asked her where she published her methods or results, what company she worked for (some advertising leads/marketing shop, iirc), and what kind of data she worked with. It was becoming apparent that she was another data science bootcamp attendee that were flooding SF at the time (2017ish). She replied to the last question with data is data, its all just math. 

After some more back and forth about how a table of values on a persons last 5 web searches, ad engagements, or magazine subscriptions is a helluva lot different than time series sensor data from a device, genomic data from a targeted/functional assay,  or spatial/geo data - she started to get more coquettish?

"I got 4 Data Science job offers with salaries between $100k - $150k in a single week, and I have a degree in English Literature","I have 3 years experience as a Data Analyst and a certificate (not a degree) an online Data Science program. Those are pretty weak credentials, and I'm sure I'm not the only person with that kind of background that starts the job search thinking there's no chance anyone would ever hire me.

I wanted to share what worked for me, just in case it can work for anybody else.

Basically, it's this:

**Treat the job interview like you're selling a service**

What worked for me was to stop thinking of it as a job interview.

Instead, imagine that you're the sales rep for a Data company answering an RFP. A client has a problem and they need a solution. You're just there to demonstrate that you can implement it.

Try to figure out what problem they're trying to solve with this role before the interview begins. That might be something like: ""We have data but we don't know how to get meaning out of it"" or ""We need to re-architect our data"" or even just: ""We have a guy who does a great job, but we need two of him.""

Center everything you say around the key message of: ""I know what your problem is and I know how to solve it.""

When they ask you to tell them about yourself:

1. Focus your answer on demonstrating that you have experience solving problems like theirs
2. Wrap it up by saying you were interested in the job because you got the impression that they need that problem solved, and you have a lot of experience solving that problem
3. Ask the interviewer if you're on the right about what problem they need solved

It's fine if you've totally misread the company. The point is that, when you ask that question, early in the interview, you force the interviewer to explain what they want the person who takes the role to be able to do.

It also switches the whole dynamic of the interview. Instead of them asking you questions, it's now about you troubleshooting that problem.

Respond by:

1. Asking clarifying questions about the problem they have
2. Explaining how you would approach the problem
3. Describing past similar projects you've worked on and how you solved them
4. Highlighting the business impact of your solutions

Doing this made a *massive* difference in my job search. I didn't hear back from any job I applied to until I tried this approach, but I heard back from everybody after I did."

I'm not sure how you got that out of this meme, but that's not my intention at all. It's made to just be funny and over-the-top. I don't believe anyone, including myself, truly feels that way.

I made a meme last week stating how some DS only utilize these two tools, and how they can feel like an imposter. Many people commented to not worry about that, and just enjoy the paycheck and the ride.

"Its companies wanting overqualified candidates for jobs that require above average intelligence so there is less chance the work gets screwed up. Same phenomena occurs in many other fields where jobs dont really require half the education they require candidates to have.

For reference, my job requires a ton of SQL work before modeling/analysis can be performed. I have seen plenty of smart people (Math/Stats/CS degrees) screw up the SQL work so badly and didnt even detect the data they analyzed and modeled was garbageand then they are trying to explain their model results to me (GI-GO issue).  

Data modeling/analysis is a several step process and its so easy to screw it up at every step along the way that the positions need overqualified candidates to reduce the number of screwups as much as possible.

"SMU.  It's part of the 2U / Bootcamp Spot / Trilogy Education wing of bootcamps.  They also service UT Austin among others, but my understanding is more that they provide the infrastructure to implement these bootcamps, and the schools select their own instructors.  I don't know about other schools, but Southern Methodist University likes to make sure their instructors have experience both with teaching and actually performing the work in the field.  Our instructor owns his own data science consulting firm that offers services to auto dealerships.  Another one does moneyball work for a baseball team.  One substitute performed work for communications between low-orbit satellites.  So the expertise offered is pretty good.

The bonus here is that upon completion, you may be eligible (pending good grades and approval) to use the bootcamp to skip the first two classes in their data science Master's degree program.

As for opportunities, I've been talking with management of a major holding firm here in Dallas, and they're going to have me do a sort of internship.  I'm looking to pad my resume, they're looking into convincing one of their subsidiaries to invest more in data science.

Whatever your experience or education, you'll get out of it what you put into it.  My group and I put in some extremely late hours into our project.  In two weeks, we made a website that shows data we scraped from about 2,400 web pages in an attempt to expose [auto dealerships which gouge on prices](https://gouge-data.herokuapp.com/).  Another group created [this page](https://paranormactivities.herokuapp.com/), which just blew all of us away with how clean and complete the site looks.

I still have a tremendous amount I need to learn on my own after class is over.  While I've taken calculus and statistics before, it's been about 10 years since I really practiced them, so I'll have to brush up on them.  I've got a stack of 11 books to get through, and no time to devote to any of them for now.  I've gone back and taken a couple college courses after I got my Bachelor's, but I never really got the chance to *apply* any of the skills I learned.  To me, that's been very frustrating, and I've ended up working at least 2 jobs a year for the past decade.  I'm done with it.  I'm tired of sweating in jeans and hoping the company I work for will expand enough for me to do more highly-skilled work.  I don't know how long I'll need to get the job I want, but I know the job is out there for me to find.

I know that's a lot more than you were asking for, but I hope it helps.  When picking out a program, one thing you'll want to check is the reviews it gets (including places like CourseReport.com), and what kind of career services it offers.  A lot of the time, you get what you pay for.  I could have gone with a program that cost half as much, but it's the career support that really makes this program stand out locally.  Also, I think SMU may be the only one that offers a very real chance to earn college credit through their bootcamp.  It ends up being a slight discount on the whole program, bolstered by the fact that you're likely to get a better paying job before continuing the degree.

Regression towards the mean and the gamblers fallacy seem contradictory. Anyone ELI5?,"['An ELI5 explanation: regression towards the mean means that outlying events will be outweighed by the mean behavior in the long run, gamblers fallacy is the belief that outlying behavior will be overcompensated by the reverse outlying behavior in order for things to average out.', 'An example of gamblers fallacy: you flip a coin ten times and get ten heads.

When in reality each coin flip is independent of each other and the likelihood of a tails is still 0.5. \n\nRegression to the mean has to do with measures that are part luck and part skill. E.g. your score on a test (the luck being that what you studied for shows up, and the skill being that you studied). So when you measure something a second time (take the test a second time), the part that is luck will be more likely to be around the mean, causing the whole measure to regress to the mean. So if you scored really highly, and studied only a little. If you were to be tested again, youd likely regress to the mean. Whereas if you studied a lot but got unlucky with what questions showed up on the first test, the second test might actually see you move up.\n\nTL;DR: gamblers fallacy has to do with misinterpreting independent events (thinking past results influence future results), and regression to the mean has to do with things that are part luck (random variation) and part skill (thinking that either the skill or luck part was the true reason some outcome happened).']"

When in reality each coin flip is independent of each other and the likelihood of a tails is still 0.5. 

Regression to the mean has to do with measures that are part luck and part skill. E.g. your score on a test (the luck being that what you studied for shows up, and the skill being that you studied). So when you measure something a second time (take the test a second time), the part that is luck will be more likely to be around the mean, causing the whole measure to regress to the mean. So if you scored really highly, and studied only a little. If you were to be tested again, youd likely regress to the mean. Whereas if you studied a lot but got unlucky with what questions showed up on the first test, the second test might actually see you move up.

TL;DR: gamblers fallacy has to do with misinterpreting independent events (thinking past results influence future results), and regression to the mean has to do with things that are part luck (random variation) and part skill (thinking that either the skill or luck part was the true reason some outcome happened).","['TIL', 'Super late reply, but regression to the mean still applies in cases of total luck. In the coin flipping example, you could get 10 heads out of 10 flips for a 100% head rate, but in the next 100 flips you still expect 50 heads and 50 tails, and in that case your head rate has gone down to 54.5%.']"

"To understand why this does happen in Excel you need to understand how Microsoft thinks. When Microsoft does something, they do it because they think the majority of people will need it this exact way, the problem is a lot of us aren't like the regular user but instead we have a bit more knowledge when it comes to data, luckily tho since we are more familiar with software we also know how to import data correctly in Excel, which is marking every column as text because only then will excel not convert it to whatever excel thinks ""this should be right"".

But ofc MS also sometimes removes functionalities that regular and advanced users need/use, best example is probably opening CSV-Files in excel. Usually when you opened it from the explorer, the import dialog immediately showed up where you can define which column is what, whats the text identifier and whats the separator. Now this doesn't work anymore, you either have to have Excel already open and use the Open File Dialog to get shown the import wizard or you open it via the file itself and then go to Data and call the import wizard from there.

But yeah most of the time MS thinks "">80% of our users will use it and have no problem and the rest can just go f*ck themselves"", that's also why windows updates by default is configured the way it is configured, to make sure the average user gets their updates in time and it installs it but you can disable automatic updates if you know how.","[""How do you disable automatic updates?

Some will be interpreted as text (because they contain characters), while others will be stripped of leasing zeros and/or converted to scientific notation.\n\nOr, enter a date in DD.MM.YY format into a cell that was formatted as ""date DD.MM.YY"". Calc _will_ interpret the date as MM.DD.YY and save it as DD.MM.YY with the days and month switched! There is no way to see what the user initially pasted. That information is just lost forever.\n\nOr, open a Calc document that uses a dot as decimal separator on a PC that uses a language with a comma as decimal separator. Lots of fun is to be had in multilingual environments.\n\nNot saying that LibreOffice is worse than MS Office.

"At the risk of sounding old, this post is but one example why Excel should not be used in science, be it in research or industry.

Excel is office spreadsheet software not intended for scientific data analysis. Excel hides/obfuscates data, incorrectly displays data, its formulas are horrid and impossible to read, it incorrectly implements statistical methods (Microsoft even has technical bulletins admitting this), produces terrible data visualizations, and it allows and encourages users to carry out poor data management practices (e.g., such as hiding columns or mixing raw data with intermediate outputs in the same sheet). All these factors mean that Excel is a serious hindrance to reproducible data science and analysis.

Yes, Excel continues to be used because it is ubiquitous and opens the doors of data analysis to non-coders, but my point stands. Whenever I receive another analyst's work in Excel with a request to repeat or extend their analysis, I get a shiver down my spine.","['Yes, currently working with someone who does the majority of their work in excel and similar GUI tools.

My Guide To Writing A Killer Cover Letter,"Most people think a cover letter is about themselves. This isnt true.

A cover letter is a marketing tool. Treat it like one and youll see it do wonders. Treat it like an autobiography and youll wonder why no one gets back to you.

Heres the cover letter formula that got me my current job:

1. **Analyzing the job description**
2. **Identifying what to include in your cover letter**
3. **Why do you want to work here?**
4. **Writing the cover letter**

**Before we get started:** this is a long post (\~3000 words). If you'd rather get a free PDF copy of it, feel free to [drop your email](https://www.careerfair.io/subscribe) here and I'll be sending it next week. 

**1/ Analyzing the job description**

Always write a cover letter from scratch. It's better to apply for five relevant positions with a complementing cover letter than to apply for fifty positions without any background research.

The best way to do this is to start by analyzing the job description.

A job description is composed of two parts:

1. What youll do
2. What the company is looking for (i.e qualifications)

First, focus on the what youll do portion. The first few bullets are the most important. And we need to make sure that theyre addressed in our cover letter. Start highlighting the ones you have experience carrying out.

https://preview.redd.it/pbakyc28yem81.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee3a2be51ee0c9d009f81068868ee28064271904

Next, take a look at the qualifications. Note down the ones you can comfortably meet and ignore any you dont. We also want to highlight the preferred or nice-to-have items listed in the job posting if you satisfy those.

*Quick note: Qualifications are always negotiable and should never deter you from applying if you think youre almost there but missing a few requirements.*

https://preview.redd.it/s1yfj6n9yem81.png?width=3424&format=png&auto=webp&s=282abefe6281837a26d748131dbb9aca1daba54d

Make sure to note all these skills youve highlighted in the job description down. Were now ready to move onto our next step.

**2/ Identifying what to include in your cover letter**

Create a table with two columns. In the left column jot down the highlighted skills you identified in the above section. And now in the right column, start writing down how you can match up to the advertised qualifications.

Heres an example for my latest role. Notice how I try to use as many of the same words as the job description:

https://preview.redd.it/xhalvb7byem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=76992f4e46b66a259504c8fb0bcc2f1ec6fca3ab

For now, just put down the qualifications without any regard for style. Also, you dont need qualifications for all the requirements. Were only going to use the top two anyway.

Struggling to come up with qualifications? Try to ask your co-workers or peers about projects theyve enjoyed working with you on. Keeping a [brag document](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/howtobragatwork) can also be really helpful.

And try to speak the employers language. So if a job description mentions QuickBooks, dont just say youve used accounting software.

**3/ Why do you want to work here?**

Youre a great fit for the role. Now you have to convince them that you want to work there.

Realize that this is just a research based question. If you do enough research, you will find information about the company that you can link back to your own interests and goals.

To help you do research, ask yourself the following questions:

* What is the companys mission?
* What problem are they trying to solve?
* Whats the product?
* Whats unique about this company compared to its competitors?
* What are some policies or values that the company has that they feature on their homepage?
* Describe any of the organizations community engagement projects or employee development programs.

A great place to find more info is to look at interviews that their founders or executives have done. Another is the companys blog.

Once youve done your research, list out *why* you find each answer to the above questions appealing. What is it about rockets that appeals to you? Why is a video messaging platform one you can connect with?

And if youve been using their product, that enthusiasm will shine through. Its not mandatory and its not even common, but when it does happen, you have a great reason for why you want to work at the company.

*Sidenote: I'm going to release a complete guide on researching companies before the interview soon. If you'd like to read that you can* [*subscribe*](https://www.careerfair.io/subscribe) *here* *and get it when it's released.*

**4/ Writing the cover letter**

Were going to use the following format for your cover letter:

*(i) Who you are, what you want, and what you believe in.*

*(ii) Transition*

*(iii). Skill & Qualification Match*

*(vi) Why do you want to work there?*

*(v) Conclusion*

***(i) Who you are, what you want, and what you believe in***

Use the first one or two sentences to make some statements about who you are, what you want, and what you believe in. Here are some good examples:

https://preview.redd.it/7tjx90ueyem81.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c769a4c46e74c14d1b52b995177237b3569ba76

Emphasize your strengths and also ideally mention something specific to the company.

***(ii) Transition***

I like to link the intro in my cover letter to the first skill-qualification match by having a summary statement and attaching it to a generic sentence:

https://preview.redd.it/65imjsigyem81.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&s=edfa8b0ec98b32708cca1db7b2c56c1b46b6fde5

The first sentence summarizes what you will bring to the company. The second helps flow into the experiences youre about to write about.

Mine would be:

*Over the last 12 months, Ive helped my company generate over $X in revenue by leading meetings with executive leaders and also built a variety of web applications on the side.*

*And now Im excited to continue my journey by contributing and growing at Adyen. There are three things that make me the perfect fit for this position:*

Here are some examples that differentiate weak and better summary statements:

https://preview.redd.it/2hssbb2iyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=09585eef6003225bfc97c0cd38d5dc122af93b0a

Avoid jargon and get specific. Half the words, twice the examples. Ideally with a few numbers sprinkled in.

*Quick Note: The summary statement is also great to add to the top of your Linkedin bio.*

***(ii) Skill & Qualification Match***

Go back to your table matching your qualifications to the requirements. Pick the two most important ones.

Were going to link your qualifications to a theme. And then use that to transform your boring bullet points into exciting sentences.

Here are eight common interview story themes:

1. Leading People
2. Taking initiative
3. Affinity for challenging work
4. Affinity for different types of work
5. Affinity for specific work
6. Dealing with failure
7. Managing conflict
8. Driven by curiosity

Let's say we ended up with the below table when analyzing a specific job description.

https://preview.redd.it/5zl2adfkyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=da38789ff4180a422a237027d1dd4827993f1dca

And lets take our first qualification:

*Conducted Feature-Mapping and Requirements Gathering sessions with prospective and existing clients to formulate Scope and Backlog. Responsible for managing and creating backlog, writing stories and acceptance criteria for all managed projects.*

Lets figure out how we can link this to one of the interview story themes:

https://preview.redd.it/mikhhw0myem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=8057bf24031ebb66a10d21aac45f5f5836bf6ed8

And here's another example:

https://preview.redd.it/otukv2rnyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=d242ebd6f3764b64ce49d530a8a22df03ddfad97

So what weve done here is abstracted some themes from this persons actual qualifications.

I know this isn't super scientific. More themes than just one work for most qualifications. But the goal is to help you solidify the type of story you want to tell.

And now that you have your theme, you can use it to guide your body paragraphs using this format:

https://preview.redd.it/hkdahc9pyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=7003513dacbe9704ed3a8b8c430f1932d4d0706a

Some more examples:

https://preview.redd.it/cql1thksyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=663d5c64f7cc9d4e63fcd37fdf0bda1358ebbdfc

***(vi) Why do you want to work there?***

Pick your two most favorite aspects about the company that you already found when doing your research. I like to pick one value driven one and one industry or current topic related. If you use their product, though, that should be first on your list.

If you want to check out some examples for this, you can do that [here](https://careerfairss.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cover_letter_guide/Screenshot+2022-03-07+at+23.30.32.png), [here](https://careerfairss.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cover_letter_guide/Screenshot+2022-03-07+at+23.30.40.png), and [here](https://careerfairss.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cover_letter_guide/Screenshot+2022-03-07+at+23.30.48.png).

Now that youve got two reasons, its time to craft together a simple paragraph that weaves them together:

*Third, Ive been following \[COMPANY\] for a couple of months now and I resonate with both the companys values and its general direction. The \[Insert Value\] really stands out to me because \[Insert Reason\]. I also recently read that \[Insert topical reason\] and this appeals to me because \[Why it appeals to you\].*

Realize that this part is your chance to bring out what you like about the company. And if you cant really think of anything, maybe you need to rethink why youre actually applying.

***(vi) Conclusion***

Simply state what you want and why you want it:

*I think youll find that my experience is a really good fit for \[COMPANY\] and specifically this position. Im ready to take my skills to the next level with your team and look forward to hearing back.*

*Thanks,*

*Your name*

**Putting it together**

Combing everything, heres what my cover letter for my current job looked like:

https://preview.redd.it/i4whem84zem81.png?width=4236&format=png&auto=webp&s=60072e121835415cbfa0f3706c91ad2faad5b1bf

And voila. You now have all the tools to write a killer cover letter.

"This looks like a great guide but unfortunately as a tech recruiter I can tell you 99% of the time cover letters are not read. 

It is much better to spend time ensuring your CV is clearly laid out, to the point, and visually pleasing. If a reader has to figure out what is going on in your CV it is not a good CV. A person must be able to look at your CV and immediately know what is going on, it should not have to be deciphered.

Bigger company recruiters dont have time to read cover letters. Smaller companies/startups might do, but at that point youre better off finding the hiring manager and/or recruiter on LinkedIn and dropping them a message to indicate your interest - youll stand out more.","['So, why ask for a cover letter?', 'I worked at Uber and one time I had one workshop with a recruiter and she said exactly this, 2 tips she gave that I always carry with me  \n\n\n* Make a resume for each role you apply so you can make it stand out  \n* Try to connect with the manager/recruiter, if is an internal transfer invite them to a coffee', 'So I read OPs suggestions and I think, oh this must be why I am not getting recognized.  Then I read your comment and get discouraged. Now I am conflicted as to whether or not I should out in the time or just keep submitting generic cover letters.

I wish companies would save the cover letter part for individuals  who are in the latter part of their interview process.', ""> I can tell you 99% of the time cover letters are not read.\n\nHiring manger -- can confirm, never read a single one.

"Good guide but...

Has anybody who actually interviews people read the cover letters or even look at it? I've done interviewing before and I've never even seen the cover letter. If this only gets to HR then it's value is pretty limited. I've additionally only seen one company actually reference my cover letter in an interview.

Additionally, I strongly disagree with this sentiment: ""It's better to apply for five relevant positions with a complementing cover letter than to apply for fifty positions without any background research."" Applying to jobs is a numbers game in my and my colleagues experience. Spending an excess amount of time when in all likelihood they toss your application in <2 minutes isn't efficient.","[""I've hired hundreds of people and I rarely read the cover letter. I usually only read it later on in the process to get additional context but you best believe that if your cover letter has more than a couple of lines/ bullet points it's getting skipped. Sadly, the people that have time to write custom cover letters are usually the weakest candidates that have to resort to that because their resumes/ experience aren't good enough. The badass applicants know they're hot commodities, specially in this industry and more often than not don't include a cover letter. Either way it can't hurt but you definitely shouldn't be spending this much time, it's all a numbers game as so much depends on what the hiring manager is specifically looking for, the biggest issues the company is facing at the time, what mood the interviewers woke up with that day,etc. If you get rejected it's not personal it's just that the company was looking for something specific that you didn't happen to have at the time. As such unless you absolutely only want to work for this company, your time is better spent applying to more or preparing for your interview loops than in a cover letter"", ""I work in a political, mission driven environment. We read resumes because we want to make sure you know what you're getting into and we need to make sure that you are aligned with our mission. \n\nWe take folks from other industries all the time just fine, even if you don't have domain specific experience, but we want to make sure you know what we do and want to be part of it. Its hard to put you in front of stakeholders if you aren't on board with what we do. I know I came in from a marketing analytics role and no political background and have had a lot of success.\n\nWe explicitly say that the cover letter is factored into our decision in the posting and give instructions for what we're looking for. \n\nWhen you have 20 qualified candidates you want to interview, its easier to toss 5 because they didn't address our questions in their cover letter and interview 15 candidates instead. Reading a cover letter and tossing takes 2-3 minutes... each interview takes a lot of time to execute."", 'YES. I have. For one, I work at places that are very mission driven and don\'t want to waste my time on someone who is very misaligned. I\'ve even written job postings explicitly saying ""please include in your cover letter your interest, experience or connection to our work."" Helpful for screening out applicants who can\'t follow directions. \n\nSecondly, at least for what I\'ve hired for -- I can screen that you have the technical skills between your resume and a short take home. What I need to know more about is how you think about and approach data problems, how you implement solutions and work with other departments, etc. The cover letter hopefully gives me some of that, and gives me something to ask about. \n\nMy experience is somewhat niche, but in my experience data skills + domain knowledge and/or non-technical experience that\'s relevant to what I need is way more important than ""has the right keywords on their resume"".\n\nI\'m sure ""it\'s a numbers game"" works for some people, but yes, 100% there are orgs who are looking for something else and spending time on a few applications will be more useful. (Plus work your networks.)\n\nAlso, I thought this approach was interesting -- no resumes, no cover letters, but specific questions to answer for each position. https://brooklyndata.pinpointhq.com/en/jobs/34867', ""At my last two companies, I never once saw a cover letter in the 300+ interviews I did.

So IMHO, more complete advice would be to write cover letter when you either have to or are pretty sure that it'd help as you know people that'd review it (professors, promotion application, etc.), but do not spend too much time on it, as managers commented here, they are rarely read, as they focus almost 100% on your resume/cv."", 'With ChatGPT solutions coming out now, you can just use AI to write it.

"In a course I had around 10 years ago, an instructor gave us a very simple mnemonic way to write cover letters: the same as a postcard to our grandma.

1- Hello grandma.

2- I hope you're doing well.

3- I'm doing very well over here.

4- I can't wait to see you again and play bridge together.

5- Kisses

\-------------------

1- Know who you are sending the letter to, good formula to start with.

2- Show that you researched the company and the role and that you are actually interested in it. Identify what they do and why it matters

3- Talk about what's relevant about you with respect to what you identified above. Insist more on personality and traits than skills: they also have your resumee so avoid redundancy.

4- Talk about what you will bring to the company. Show that you understand what they need and that you already constructively project yourself in the role.

5- Politeness formula to end

And just like a postcard: keep it short and to the point.

\-----------------

This shit is so good, I never had to look again at my notes from this course, never forgot how to make one, and everytime some friends showed me cover letters they wrote they were way worse than mines. It also make it a very simple and efficient process to write one. You know exactly what you need to research, what you need to write and what you're trying to convey when writing it.",['Love this']

"I work in a political, mission driven environment. We read resumes because we want to make sure you know what you're getting into and we need to make sure that you are aligned with our mission. 

We take folks from other industries all the time just fine, even if you don't have domain specific experience, but we want to make sure you know what we do and want to be part of it. Its hard to put you in front of stakeholders if you aren't on board with what we do. I know I came in from a marketing analytics role and no political background and have had a lot of success.

We explicitly say that the cover letter is factored into our decision in the posting and give instructions for what we're looking for. 

When you have 20 qualified candidates you want to interview, its easier to toss 5 because they didn't address our questions in their cover letter and interview 15 candidates instead. Reading a cover letter and tossing takes 2-3 minutes... each interview takes a lot of time to execute.","[""The recurring theme seems to be that mission driven environments are where it matters.\n\nThat said, it sounds like asking for short form, one paragraph answers to questions would work better for your interview process. Does the dog and pony show of rewriting your resume, saying why you're such a good fit, and adding the answers to your cover letter really add value over direct questions and direct answers? Is there really a need to consult a ~3,000 word guide to write a cover letter when simple question to answer might be the easier and simpler?""]"
"YES. I have. For one, I work at places that are very mission driven and don't want to waste my time on someone who is very misaligned. I've even written job postings explicitly saying ""please include in your cover letter your interest, experience or connection to our work."" Helpful for screening out applicants who can't follow directions. 

Secondly, at least for what I've hired for -- I can screen that you have the technical skills between your resume and a short take home. What I need to know more about is how you think about and approach data problems, how you implement solutions and work with other departments, etc. The cover letter hopefully gives me some of that, and gives me something to ask about. 

My experience is somewhat niche, but in my experience data skills + domain knowledge and/or non-technical experience that's relevant to what I need is way more important than ""has the right keywords on their resume"".

I'm sure ""it's a numbers game"" works for some people, but yes, 100% there are orgs who are looking for something else and spending time on a few applications will be more useful. (Plus work your networks.)

Also, I thought this approach was interesting -- no resumes, no cover letters, but specific questions to answer for each position. https://brooklyndata.pinpointhq.com/en/jobs/34867","['Yup. I interviewed for two very mission driven organizations (their tagline is literally we want to improve the human condition) and the cover letters got referenced in my interviews.\n\nThey do get read.

It's highly groomed, just like resumes, and the interviews often show their experience when you ask for caveats or fine details that resumes / cover letters will rarely cover. I've interviewed people whose resumes say they know technical skills and have done data projects, but when interviewed they fumble hard and show that they don't know what they're doing.\n\nAs for it being a numbers game, working your network is definitely the number one strategy. But anecdotally and from peers, cover letters for job postings barely work. Cover letters may give you something like +50% ping backs but I can easily apply to 200-400% more jobs in the time it takes to make a cover letter. Additionally where cover letters are required, I have barely noticed any difference from a mostly canned cover letter with minor adjustments to a completely customized one. That's also if it is even relevant, nothing worse than spending a ton of time to get an instant rejection from a company. If you're getting instantly rejected, much better use of time to apply more.\n\nNow if I KNEW that it was going to be read, i.e. they're a company that says they care, or it was a referral, I would put in the effort, it would be worth it."", 'That job i would never apply to.

"At my last two companies, I never once saw a cover letter in the 300+ interviews I did. When I was doing initial resume reviews, I would look at a resume for <1 minute to decide whether to give them a 20 minute first screen or not. No way would I read a wall of text cover letter.

A long form prose document is sort of unusually in most corporate settings. Almost everything written is meant to be skimmed. It's either short like an email or slack message.

Because her background told her that it's inappropriate to code a feature in a way that doesn't accurately represent it.

If my stats and data can back up the research, I can at least *germinate* the challenging idea in their minds. The strategy here is to not drop a bombshell on management but slowly disseminate information to them, preferably from someone inside management.

"Speaking in absolutes has never worked in anyones favor. Think about what you just stated. There are no unbiased journalists. How do you know that for sure? There are a few things that make good hypotheses. One is that the hypothesis has to be testable. The second is that is must be falsifiable. So lets look at your example one more time. Is it testable? Sure, we can evaluate every journalist we come across and determine their level of bias. But is it falsifiable? No. Why you might ask? Because we are unable to test EVERY journalist. Its impossible. So to speak in absolutes and say all journalists are biased is just bad practice. Im trying to point out a common fallacy here - our mind likes to create stories based on information that is readily available and we have been exposed to often. I encourage you to look up what an availability heuristic is. 

I think you misunderstand what I mean by peer reviewed journal articles. By peer it evaluates to those who are subject matter experts in their field and heavily scrutinize the work of other scientists in order to lead to more generalizable, comparable, and accurate study models. Rarely ever is a study published without revisions. 

Im curious to know why you think they cant be trusted. Keep in mind practically every single breakthrough whether it be clinical or technological in nature to this day has been evaluated in depth by subject matter experts. The fact that our mortality rates have plummeted over the past 150 years is because one man was brave enough to establish that washing your hands more frequently leads to better health. Everybody thought he was a hack, but guess what - he was right. And study after study after study has proven this. So my question to you is - if they cant be trusted, that is, subject matter experts, how do we evaluate the information as lay people? I certainly would not want to be in charge of evaluating the accuracy of a fusion reactor or the stability of a rocket engine, would you?

Quality of life DOES come from balance: personal talents, EQ and emotional management, opportunities taken or passed over, health, community identity, and a sense of relevance with self-determination, along with the vagaries of luck.  I absolutely agree that corporate America focuses on profits (often unreasonable) at any cost, and this focus on ever-growing profits can hit workers hard on all personal and work-related levels.  This impact has destroyed many dedicated people who have committed their lives to the success (profit growth) of the corporation they work for. This is where we agree, and we both might suggest an introduction of the word enough (what IS enough) to create a conversation about synergistic corporate paradigm change.  Where we do not agree has to do with giving up ones personal commitment to excellence (going beyond what is expected), a character trait.  This commitment shows up in relationships, ones own lifestyle - virtually in all one does.  The issue here may have more to do with disappointed expectations than with corporate commitment to the well-being of workers.  The environments of workers in corporations are crafted to create unquestioned commitment to the production of profit.  Team-building, perks, acknowledgments, impressive titles, and other methods ARE seductive and effective at creating a FEELING of being part of a work family with shared objectives.  However, commitment to family and commitment to Corporate America are different and result in different outcomes when expectations are not met. Corporations expect growing profit, family expects continued relatedness.  It is important not to conflate the two.  Excellence as a character trait will pick us up after we recover from a fall because it is essentially about self determination, and self-determination is important for our well-being.', 'Part of your point makes sense to me, but your assumptions and examples betray the logic and weaken your argument IMO. I agree that sweeping layoffs without consideration of how the strong team members could carry on is short sighted. However,\n\nAssumptions:  it is a corporate officers job to steer the ship and make tough decisions of strategy. If the company has to change directions to stay legitimate in the market, then that includes making big decisions about choosing among products and services that have best promise. These are tough calls. There will be error, but making those decisions is how a free market works (and should), although I feel empathy for the lost jobs because it can be a very difficult struggle from which to recover. Been there. \n\nExamples: a car isnt going to fall apart without hubcaps, spare tires, and air caps. These things are by definition cosmetic or convenient, and the market is stating these things are not required.  If by the same token, the products/services/features being developed by the tech team are irrelevant, then the market is choosing not to pay for them. \n\nThe signal then IMO is for data scientists and similar tech professions (Im a DS/manager/product owner) is to take it upon themselves to embrace the uncomfortable challenge of determining what is important and why, and strive to be at the center of the target of your organizations value proposition (not at the periphery, and you have to learn to tell the difference).  It is not good enough to know some methods, apply them and shit out some numbers then walk away (how I see many ppl approach their roles).  \n\nYou have to use the lens of the world which has the yoke of the stress and uncertainty and risk that the corporate officers face, that there are no obvious answers and competitors are coming for you all the time. Its not enough to just show up and say tell me what to do. You have to take an active stance. In a free market, there is no real security beyond hustle, good critical thinking, consistent value creation, and a sense of ownership. \n\nOf note: Im not suggesting your corporate decisions were good or that you personally dont have this sense of ownership.

"I've said this countless times.

Work as if you have a yearly contract with a company. During that year, you will provide a value to the company for a wage, you will hopefully gain valuable experience that will help you land the next gig, and you will hopefully be challenged enough to stay. We will gain something valuable for the output you give, we will hopefully help you move on to the next gig, and challenge you enough to stay for the next year if all things work out.

If you go into a job thinking a for profit company owes you anything, then you're setting yourself up to fail. Everyone is replaceable and the business is not responsible for your life. If you want to take this as a justification for doing mediocre work, just doing enough to get by, half-assing it to pull a paycheck, and nothing more. Then it's going to be hard to justify your role during a cutback and equally hard for you to find the next gig. Do not set your future up for failure like that. Do a good job while you can, but do so understanding that in a year, you may be looking for the next challenge. Set yourself up to be the candidate people want.

I've been fired, frozen, just simply laid off because of redundancy. Shit happens.

I can tell you one thing for sure. When I was the top of my game. Like truly the top. That's when I was the last person in the room with a job. If I wasn't, I was in a new job within a week because word does get around if you are doing a piss poor job.",['Are you sure it wasnt just some balance of you being competent and at that mid range of acceptable salaries?

"Actually, I feel the same thing. (Btw, sorry for any grammar mistakes, english is not my first language)

For 4 years I worked for a huge bank in the IT department. As an Intern, I worked many, MANY extra hours for free (even more during the Pandemic). And even after I was promoted and climbed my way up to the Web Developer || position, I still worked til late at night, almost every day. Eventually, after a few changes on the  teams, I was left by myself in a very important project, still maintaining the projects webpage by myself (and knowing it was the homepage for that bank, it was A LOT of work). No matter how many times I asked for more developers and testers, no one listened and kept throwing more stuff for me to do (I did my job very well, so they just gave me more stuff everytime).

In the end, I was burnt out, with enough problems and projects for 3 or 4 people (and I know this number because after I left, they had to put 4 developers to do my job and, even though I left very extensive documentation, they still messed up a lot, and couldnt deliver half of what I did), and very, very anxious, having anxiety attaks quite often. I was going to therapy during this whole thing but, still, I was a mess. And for what? When I quit they gaslighted me, talked badly of me behind my back and refused to admit I was overloaded with work (going as far as saying I wasnt up for promotion anytime soon and I still had a lot of self development to do in order to be promoted).

So, no matter what, dont overload yourself with work thinking the company will see you efforts. They wont. And youll end up in a massive burnout and stuck where you are.

He will probably serve the rest of his term and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about it. Most of the accusations don't stick because they are simply made up by the media.

Trump capitalizes on the fact that he is SO SHOCKING and media will take any bait given to them and blow it out of proportion, so that when the dust settles and he is investigated and they find that he actually didn't do anything wrong. To his supporters, this looks exactly like a witch hunt because they keep accusing him and 3 years later nothing has stuck. 

It is bloody genius to stir up so much shit and be squeaky clean while everything around you is sprayed in diarrhea and is on fire.

Mark my words and watch him win the next election because Bernie goes full socialist and puts fear into capitalist americans or something and we're up for a new round of the roller coaster.","['The media doesnt just make things up, and Trump isnt squeaky clean. If things dont stick, its because there is a legitimate scandal big enough to have completely derailed Obamas presidency every week, and people cant keep track. \n\nThe republicans are also holding a united front, denying reality in unison, smearing witnesses and whistleblowers, and when the evidence becomes too overwhelming, denying that what was done was a big deal. Then the have another scandal to change the subject.\n\nIf a lie is big enough that people say I could never say that and get away with it if it werent true, when a lie is told often enough, people who dont know any better will believe. Its a standard propaganda technique and youve fallen prey to it. But ask yourself which is more likely: that thousands of reporters working for dozens of media companies are uncovering and corobborating crimes, corruption, malfeasance, and more and a political establishment is denying it to save their own asses, or there is a massive conspiracy by everybody in the media to make things up again and again and again in an effort to tarnish Trump? \n\nYou can be forgiven for being so wrong on this if you are only getting your news from Fox News, as they are a propoganda network conceived of by Roger Ailes back when he was working for Nixon as a way to prevent an impeachment of a future version of Nixon by making sure that there were enough people taken in by a conservative spin on the facts instead of led to the obvious conclusions by the facts themselves. You are a victim of a right wing conspiracy to deliberately misinform people so that those in power can remain so. But you can stop being a victim by increasing your news consumption to a diverse list of sources, thinking about your news critically, and then using Occams razor when there are discrepancies. \n\nOr you can continue believing that an industry that fired Dan Rather because he ran a story on George W Bushs time in the Texas air national guard based on documents that the administration claimed were inaccurate but which nobody ever showed false would suddenly switch from destroying the careers of people who let slip stories that might not be 100% correct to working completely in unison to peddle false stories.\n\nBe honest, which is more likely?']"
"Here's the thing about consulting. The amount you charge sits on a spectrum. 

On one side is the amount of time it would take the client to do it themselves with their internal resources, including the learning time. If a 50 year old middle manager would need to do a crash course in data science, you could easily be looking at tens of thousands of dollars in lost productivity/costs. 

On the other side is how much time it will take you, the subject matter expert, who doesn't have to do any learning and has likely solved the problem same problem dozens of times. You might even have a ready-built solution you made for another client. Even at a high charge-out rate, your actual time could be measures in the hundreds of dollars in some cases.

Now as a data scientist and/or logical person, you would think that a manager would want to pay as little as possible to fix a problem. But you'd be wrong, because it reflects poorly on someone to have had to hire an external consultant to solve a problem that was fixable in an hour and cost $200. In order for them, as managers, do demonstrate the value of the project, it helps for it to have been expensive and complex.

So you, as a consultant, get to help them do their job well by continuing that narrative. And as long as the rate you charge lays somewhere below what it would cost them to ultimately just learn and do it themselves, everyone is happy.

This is a great thing to know both as a consultant and as a person who also engages consultants. As long as you know the game that's being played, you can ensure that the deal struck is the best one for your personal situation.",['I was just doing a play on the word con-sult']

He could get support from people when he supported obviously impossible policies.  A rich New Yorker who had a history of failure was able to project the appearance that he was successful and cared deeply about people in middle America.  

Anybody with a lick of sense could tell he was full of shit.  But he was effective at wooing those without sense, as well as getting several who should have known better not to care. People bent over backwards to rationalize supporting him.  And a good number won't get back on their feet for any reason.

His presidency has been an unmitigated disaster.  But his campaigning was dangerously effective.  So much so that he may have a permanent effect on electoral politics, or at the very least change the way the republican party functions for a generation. 

> Only positive thing I can possibly think of is China having to deal with him. That's about the only effective positive thing I can think of.

Trump has been neither effective nor positive with regard to China. 
 Trump's pulling out of TPP ceded a lot of American influence in the Pacific Rim to China. There is plenty of room to argue that it would have benefited American businesses more than American consumers, but by walking away from the negotiating table, it meant that no American interests would benefit.  

The trade war hasn't netted any gains, has bankrupted a lot of small farms, caused Brazillians to burn the rain forest so they could sell China the soybeans that the US won't, driven up prices on many goods, and for what? China has too much at stake to just fold, and they aren't small enough to be pushed around.  I'm not a fan of the Chinese profiting by violating IP, workers, and the environment, but this was not the way to get them to stop. We've put them in a position where there is no way they can lose while still saving face, which means there is no way they will agree to anything that is viewed as a loss.  Like most of Trump's plans, this will not end well for anybody.","[""Ah, effective in campaigning.  I'd say a huge portion of that was just the divisive, bitterness that has been sowed over the years by Republicans.

How to get a job in data science - a semi-harsh Q/A guide.,"**HOW DO I GET A JOB IN DATA SCIENCE?**

Hey you. Yes you, person asking ""how do I get a job in data science/analytics/MLE/AI whatever BS job with data in the title?"". I got news for you. There are two simple rules to getting one of these jobs.

1. Have experience.

2. Don't have no experience.

There are approximately 1000 entry level candidates who think they're qualified because they did a 24 week bootcamp for every entry level job. I don't need to be a statistician to tell you your odds of landing one of these aren't great.

**HOW DO I GET EXPERIENCE?**

Are you currently employed? If not, get a job. If you are, figure out a way to apply data science in your job, then put it on your resume. Mega bonus points here if you can figure out a way to attribute a dollar value to your contribution. Talk to your supervisor about career aspirations at year-end/mid-year reviews. Maybe you'll find a way to transfer to a role internally and skip the whole resume ignoring phase. Alternatively, network. Be friends with people who are in the roles you want to be in, maybe they'll help you find a job at their company.

**WHY AM I NOT GETTING INTERVIEWS?**

IDK. Maybe you don't have the required experience. Maybe there are 500+ other people applying for the same position. Maybe your resume stinks. If you're getting 1/20 response rate, you're doing great. Quit whining. 

**IS XYZ DEGREE GOOD FOR DATA SCIENCE?**

Does your degree involve some sort of non-remedial math higher than college algebra? Does your degree involve taking any sort of programming classes? If yes, congratulations, your degree will pass most base requirements for data science. Is it the best? Probably not, unless you're CS or some really heavy math degree where half your classes are taught in Greek letters. Don't come at me with those art history and underwater basket weaving degrees unless you have multiple years experience doing something else.

**SHOULD I DO XYZ BOOTCAMP/MICROMASTERS?**

Do you have experience? No? This ain't gonna help you as much as you think it might. Are you experienced and want to learn more about how data science works? This could be helpful.

**SHOULD I DO XYZ MASTER'S IN DATA SCIENCE PROGRAM?**

Congratulations, doing a Master's is usually a good idea and will help make you more competitive as a candidate. Should you shell out 100K for one when you can pay 10K for one online? Probably not. In all likelihood, you're not gonna get $90K in marginal benefit from the more expensive program. Pick a known school (probably avoid really obscure schools, the name does count for a little) and you'll be fine. Big bonus here if you can sucker your employer into paying for it.

**WILL XYZ CERTIFICATE HELP MY RESUME?**

Does your certificate say ""AWS"" or ""AZURE"" on it? If not, no.

**DO I NEED TO KNOW XYZ MATH TOPIC?**

Yes. Stop asking. Probably learn probability, be familiar with linear algebra, and understand what the hell a partial derivative is. Learn how to test hypotheses. Ultimately you need to know what the heck is going on math-wise in your predictions otherwise the company is going to go bankrupt and it will be all your fault. 

**WHAT IF I'M BAD AT MATH?**

Git gud. Do some studying or something. MIT opencourseware has a bunch of free recorded math classes. If you want to learn some Linear Algebra, Gilbert Strang is your guy. 

**WHAT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES SHOULD I LEARN?**

STOP ASKING THIS QUESTION. I CAN GOOGLE ""HOW TO BE A DATA SCIENTIST"" AND EVERY SINGLE GARBAGE TDS ARTICLE WILL TELL YOU SQL AND PYTHON/R. YOU'RE LUCKY YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE JOY OF SEGMENTATION FAULTS TO RUN A SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION. 

**SHOULD I LEARN PYTHON OR R?**

Both. Python is more widely used and tends to be more general purpose than R. R is better at statistics and data analysis, but is a bit more niche. 
Take your pick to start, but ultimately you're gonna want to learn both you slacker.

**SHOULD I MAKE A PORTFOLIO?**

Yes. And don't put some BS housing price regression, iris classification, or titanic survival project on it either. Next question.

**WHAT SHOULD I DO AS A PROJECT?**

IDK what are you interested in? If you say twitter sentiment stock market prediction go sit in the corner and think about what you just said. Every half brained first year student who can pip install sklearn and do model.fit() has tried unsuccessfully to predict the stock market. The efficient market hypothesis is a thing for a reason. There are literally millions of other free datasets out there you have one of the most powerful search engines at your fingertips to go find them. Pick something you're interested in, find some data, and analyze it. 

**DO I NEED TO BE GOOD WITH PEOPLE?** (courtesy of /u/bikeskata)

Yes! First, when you're applying, no one wants to work with a weirdo. You should be able to have a basic conversation with people, and they shouldn't come away from it thinking you'll follow them home and wear their skin as a suit. Once you get a job, you'll be interacting with colleagues, and you'll need them to care about your analysis. Presumably, there are non-technical people making decisions you'll need to bring in as well. If you can't explain to a moderately intelligent person why they should care about the thing that took you 3 days (and cost $$$ in cloud computing costs), you probably won't have your position for long. You don't need to be the life of the party, but you should be pleasant to be around.

"great post. Will just share my experience as someone who made an early career pivot from non-science role to DS. FWIW, have always had relative ease (able to quickly learn) when it comes to technical / computer / math stuff, but ended up getting Urban Planning undergrad (not much technical / math required). 

Worked for a few years, started getting good at excel data analysis and GIS (ArcMap / QGIS etc.) on-the-job and decided I wanted to dive fully into DS.

Rather than pursue a CS or generic DS grad program, I found a program that intersected DS & Urban Planning (specifically titled ""Urban Informatics""). Program focused a bit on urban theory / etc. but mostly taught the technical (statistics, programming, database management, ML, etc.) and EVERY class project was oriented towards urban planning / smart city related ""problems"". Given I already had the subject matter background / passion, that lens motivated me and made it much more tangible when learning the technical concepts.

I graduated, got an entry-level DS job (also in the ""smart city"" space), promoted to Senior DS in <2 years, promoted to Product Manager <2 years after that.

It's totally doable, but DS roles are becoming more and more niche / diversified. **My advice would be to pick a particular niche / path and pursue that** (as opposed to saying ""I want to get into DS""... OK great, that could mean 1,000 different things)","[""This is super interesting. I've been thinking about pivoting to the urban planning field from marketing analytics, but have had trouble figuring out how. Can I ask what kind of work you do? Do you work directly with a city or is it with some kind of firm? Are there many roles available? What does your typical day look like?\n\nSorry for the barrage of questions but I had not heard of Urban infomatics despite my interest in urban planning going back years. I've only seen folks discuss in ArcGIS stuff so I never dug deeper."", ""I agree with this. Right now I just completed my DS master's and I have tried to focus my projects on Construction sector, manufacturing or web. I have an undergrad degree in building and over 10 years experience writing software, especially web and mobile. Also big interest in manufacturing tech. So my focus is mostly on these areas. I could also see myself working in retail, but less likely in something like health, although I can be actually adapt to many things.""]"

> Mega bonus points here if you can figure out a way to attribute a dollar value to your contribution.

Most of the time I see dollar value attributions on a resume, it's a yellow flag to me.  It reeks of bullshit and a lack of understanding most of the time.","[""This is a very fair point. If you put dollar signs on any sort of resume then they should deservedly be questioned. My reasoning for including dollar (now that I think about this, I probably should have tried to be a bit more inclusive to our non-American friends - maybe monetary value would be a better term here?) signs as a because it shows me a candidate is thinking about the business value side of things in addition to the technical skills. That and it might help the resume make it past the first HR layer of scrutiny. Once they're in the interview process, grill 'em on the measurement specifics - you can tell pretty quickly who has no idea what they actually did.""]"
"Unpopular opinion here from someone working in the field for many years, math isnt as important as some aficionados report. Yes, and understanding of linear algebra and calculus can be useful, however, shipping products that deliver value is most important over everything else. 

Did you use some basic sklearn model that you dont fully understand at the mathematical level, but generally understand its benefits/limitations/applicability? Does it deliver value to your company? AMAZING!

Did you write a report to your leader telling them why XYZ may not theoretically work because of a lemma that you leaned in uni and you can solve differential equations to show it? Cool? Really need to think about if this delivers value or not. Oh sure, maybe you can prevent investment in an area thats doomed to failure, but realistically 99% of the time your time would be beater spent putting the math texts down and delivering data products.

Your ultimate goal and focus should be to deliver value to the company.

If you go to some stakeholder and try to explain why something theoretically works because of the math, you're going to see their eyes glaze over.\n\nMy thought on math is you should have at least some baseline level of math knowledge that can help you reliably assess the limitations and assumptions a specific model is making, and potential cases where it can lead to bad or biased results.

Managers by and large can\'t even define what ""business value"" is, it\'s like a buzz word.

You can\'t fake that and it\'s absolutely useful in data science. It\'s hard to even describe how that works. To make an attempt, it helps you cross some methods off the table, or hone in on the right area to make improvements in your model, faster.\n\nI can\'t even count the number of times some seemingly esoteric thing from some math class I hardly ever used came in handy to simplify a problem or factor a problem into subproblems.\n\nPeople new to the ML field that lack that math background often make nave mistakes when building models, or try to fit square pegs in round holes by using the wrong model for a problem.\n\nIf you are educated in mathematics you know it when you see it. People that lack the background make more mistakes or do things the hard way.\n\nOne way to add ""value"" is not to waste your time chasing the wrong thing.

"Yes, frequently. Many advantages. A few that come to mind. 

* Still unmatched for classical time-series analysis (thanks Hyndman). 
* Much better frequentist multi-level modeling frameworks (lme4) than python. 
* ggplot is far, far better than \[plotting library you might be thinking of in python that takes 50 lines of code to do what ggplot can do in 8, and somehow still doesn't format quite right\]
* RMarkdown has no good python equivalent (yes, I know what notebooks are; they don't do the same things or render as flexibly in static reports). 
* I love Shiny for quick UIs. Python has nothing like it (everything comparable takes far more work and more boilerplate; Shiny is so wonderfully simple).
* Rstudio is the best data analysis IDE in existence. Python has no equivalent. Pycharm professional with scientific mode can be configured to be kind of close. But it costs money, is vastly more memory intensive, and isn't as good. Exclusively from a data analysis perspective at least; Pycharm is far better at everything else an IDE does. But Rstudio is designed for one thing, and it's really good at it. That's the secret of a lot of the things that work about R that python hasn't matched.

All that being said, I mainly use python. Most common libraries are in python, and it is way, way better for production code. R is a struggle in production, to put it mildly. It's just not made to be production code. It can be done, and done well. But you end up working against the language a lot more than is ideal. Have developed several things that use R scripts as callables to take advantage of some of those things.","['I am working in the automotive engineering domain and had a discussion with a colleague about MATLAB recently. This quick analysis with the UIs, exportable fig files, many application specific utilities is so helpful.\n\nOfc, matlab is not the best ecosystem in terms of software engineering but still a powerful engineering tool. \n\nPython is powerful in terms of its extensibility and large community but sometimes there are industry specific ecosystems better suited for a task.']"

"When you suggest networking as a job strategy, most are so quick to brush it off with ugh but I hate networking. Ok? Theres no magic workaround. A good network is SO valuable. And its really not that hard to build one, but it does take time. People are willing to spend thousands of dollars on a masters degree (or bootcamp), and/or bust their butt to learn all these advanced technologies. But they arent willing to take an hour or two out of their evening once in awhile, to show up to a meetup event, walk up to a stranger, and say, so, what do you do? And with everything virtual, you dont even have to go to events in person anymore!! You can attend virtual events and talk to people through a screen. 

Whats even worse (in my opinion) is people who enroll in a masters program and then *dont network with their classmates.* I have classmates in my program working or interning at some pretty big name companies (or landing a job there post-graduation), its such a treasure trove of networking opportunities, and I see so many who dont take advantage of it. 

Networking is a much better ROI for your time than reading a million Medium articles or trying to learn advanced technologies that 95% of companies will never need.","['I always get defensive on this topic, even though I know, theoretically, it\'s true.

"Before my DS pivot, I worked in ""traditional"" urban planning roles (consulting + government). Currently, I work in the automotive industry, but in the ""smart city / mobility"" division of my company. In short, we're responsible for figuring out how these new transportation technologies (EV, AV, connectivity, data, smart infrastructure, rideshare, micromobility, etc.) can be a part of my company's future. We use data analytics to support business decisions in this space. A few examples:

* Develop a prioritization framework for what cities / neighborhoods we should expand a new service to
* Model which roads have the greatest safety risk to support autonomous vehicle simulation
* Help analyze connected vehicle data to determine which road segments have good / bad lane marking quality to flag where certain vehicle features (e.g., lane keep assist) can safely operate
* Build a SaaS product that incorporates vehicle data and public data about traffic flow that will be sold directly to governments / cities to use

There are lots of opportunities in this space, not just ""mobility"" related, but smart city in general. Lots of transportation / urban planning consultancies are expanding their data science teams, and many governments are doing the same.

As a Product Manager, my typical day is a lot different compared to when I was in an individual contributor DS role. As a DS, my typical day was some meetings with the business team I was supporting, \~5 hours of data wrangling, coding (R/Python), viz, developing summary documentation / slides, etc. depending on the stage of the project I was supporting, and some internal DS team meetings.

"I agree. The OP seems like they have a management background. Managers by and large can't even define what ""business value"" is, it's like a buzz word. It sounds good but means nothing without a huge amount of context.

Cool, yeah we all want more profits in business, but what drives that? Are you focusing on cutting down on people-hours? Selling more of X kind of product? Choosing the best vendors?

How would you go about teaching someone to ""derive business value""? It seems highly dependent on what your business does, and businesses are complex even though managers like to oversimplify them (to their detriment I personally believe).

Math is taught the way it is for a reason. One class builds on the last and practice is necessary to be able to understand the level after.

While you may not use 90% of what you learned in a math program that 10% comes in handy and requires the other 90% to understand correctly.

Beyond that, you're supposed to practice lots of problems so you build intuition and ""muscle memory"". You can't fake that and it's absolutely useful in data science. It's hard to even describe how that works. To make an attempt, it helps you cross some methods off the table, or hone in on the right area to make improvements in your model, faster.

I can't even count the number of times some seemingly esoteric thing from some math class I hardly ever used came in handy to simplify a problem or factor a problem into subproblems.

People new to the ML field that lack that math background often make nave mistakes when building models, or try to fit square pegs in round holes by using the wrong model for a problem.

If you are educated in mathematics you know it when you see it. People that lack the background make more mistakes or do things the hard way.

One way to add ""value"" is not to waste your time chasing the wrong thing. That careful math-educated person might superficially seem to be wasting people's time with theorems or experiments but they could actually be getting the right answer you need faster than someone spinning their wheels to get something rushed out the door to ""derive business value NOW"".

I personally think American managers are largely part of some kind of cargo cult of pseudo-professionals. Nobody is interested in true R&D anymore, that's too risky. Instead they want ROI yesterday without considering long term costs. If it's not in a spreadsheet and to the quarter it doesn't exist!","[""> I personally think American managers are largely part of some kind of cargo cult of pseudo-professionals.

"The real answer is it depends on the use case. If you are smart you understand that most DBs have different strengths and weaknesses. For instance an RBAC service if I was writing one it would 100% be in mongodb, you insert a document per user, tag their roles and done. There is no need to use relational structures for that. But then if you are doing something that requires for instance complex relationships but with static ish data then SQL is perfect for that. In truth I'd say the modern stack looks like postgres, mongodb and elasticsearch in most cases and doesn't need anything specifically fancy for any of the 3. If you are writing stupid stuff to get around the DB in any specific part that's a sign you have to change something.","['Please take your reasoned, nuanced perspective and kindly leave this forum. :p', 'This.

"What's a good rule of thumb regarding the computational limit of a query, as in a query or queries are doing things which should be done somewhere else?","[""It's hard to give the best answer without going into specific use cases and why. For example I don't mind defaulting to everything being in SQL just as long as you understand SQL is by default fairly heavy in heavy use. That's where you need to chain specific things. Like for instance using MongoDB as a data warehouse and then regularly clearing data from Postgres when it falls out of use. \n\nFor example my company currently stores audit level stuff in the DB. This thing is changed, this status changed...etc. It's way too much detail but what you can do is take slices of that data and store it for later for instance for dashboarding. You can do that with Elasticsearch and graph in Kibana or you could put it into Mongodb and enrich the data by linking it to user accounts to make the service work better. For example frequently ordered items from all users can be tracked in MongoDB really loosely by storing rolled up data from Postgres. It saves time on development because mongodb is easier to use than SQL queries and it saves money on complex queries happening regularly to the Postgres directly. \n\nA big note about Postgres or any SQL DB is that they don't scale well to millions of users, you have to use tricks or other DBs to make it work in the way I described for MongoDB in the use case above. Picking a specific DB is the tricky part. There are loads of options, influxdb is popular right now for time series data and definitely not a bad choice for that purpose. Elasticsearch handles time series data fine too but is really focused on fast access which you might find other options with nicer tools for your project. It all is research for what fits the use case rather than what tools you like. If it was just tools you liked most developers would just pick an SQL based one like postgres 100% of the time but I think there is value in others beyond even just performance.""]"

Here are the questions I was asked for my entry level DS job!,"Hey everyone. I posted a thread a few days ago about being nervous about my first DS interview. The thread was taken down by mods due to it being more appropriate for the stickied thread. So I want to make this thread less about questions, but more of an informative post to show you some of the questions I was asked. Hopefully it's helpful for newbies and veterans alike!

&#x200B;

**SQL:**

* What is a view?
* Is a table dynamic or static?
* Difference between a primary key and foreign key
* Inner Join vs. Left Join scenario (pretty sure it was from w3schools. ez pz)
* WHERE vs. HAVING
* When would you use a subquery? Provide an example
* How would you improve the performance of a slow query?
* EDIT: Some aggregation and GROUP by questions (MAX, AVG, COUNT, etc.) that I just remembered.

**Python**

* Explanation of libraries I use (Pandas mainly)
* How would you get the maximum result from a list?
* Can you explain the concept of functions
* Difference between FOR and WHILE loops?
* Give some examples of how you would clean dirty data.

**Tableau:**

* What is a calculated field? Provide some examples in your work
* What is the difference between a live view and extract? When would you use each?
* More information given on the data I work with

**Statistics:**

* Explain what a p-value is to someone who has no idea what that is.
* Explanation on linear/logistic regression modeling.
* What is standard deviation? Examples?
* Difference between STDEV and Variance?
* What statistics do you currently work with? (Descriptive mainly... mean, median, mode, stdev, confidence intervals)

I advanced to round 3 immediately, which is pretty much a shoe-in according to the hiring manager. I am very excited because it seems like a great opportunity. Even if I don't get it, I still felt like I interviewed very well and did my best. I am very proud of myself.

"Answers from my experience (and probably why I cant find better work):

* view - clever hack when your org is stuck in 2002 using SSRS and MS Report Builder to make datasets. Also a good alternative to CTE when nested in other views when MS SSMS cocks up the syntax because its auto linting sucks.

* table dynamism - it could be dynamic, it could be static. Ive definitely had a nonCS background staff member ask me how to dynamically change table column names and dynamically update them. He found a stack overflow example that couldve worked in theory. Just because you can doesnt mean you should.

* primary vs foreign - self explanatory

* inner vs left - inner covers 80% of cases, left is for when it doesnt.

* where vs having - 99% of the time where is sufficient.

* I hate subqueries. Too many nonCS people nesting them 35 subqueries deep and then asking me to debug because it doesnt work. Just use CTEs and then refactor those out to views.

* slow queries - 99% of the time its either my employers slow ass VPN or their slow ass virtualized SQL server.

* Python libraries - too many, but pandas for data frames and file reading into data frames, and numpy for some other stuff. os because its useful. SQLAlchemy because I hate stored procedures for no reason. Scikit learn because duh.

* honestly dont know off the top of my head but Id try just wrapping with max(), then .max(), then np.max(), then stack overflow.

* functions - callable reusable code that does a thing.

* for vs while - for will end in theory, but not always when cocked up by some nonCS accounting clerk playing at knowing technology who decided to reassign the loop variable value each iteration. Definitely seen this one take down core banking mainframe when there was a file create line in the iteration too - yes your money is managed by systems this unstable.

* cleaning data is a process too lengthy to explain in an interview.","['These arent answers to the questions, youre just rambling']"

I\'ve always felt that a combined philosophy of either agility and slow robust implementation allows for fit for use solutions.  \n\nTo put it into the ""big ship"" metaphor, the enterprise is still a large ship that is difficult to steer, but it has access to smaller more agile vessels that allow it to capture opportunities.

Companies are finally hiring,"I applied to 80+ jobs before the new year and got rejected or didnt hear back from most of them. A few positions were a level or two lower than my currently level. I got only 1 interview and I did accept the offer. 

In the last week, 4 companies reached out for interviews. Just want to put this out there for those who are still looking. Keep going at it. 

Edit - thank you all for the congratulations and Im sorry I cant respond to DMs. Here are answers to some common questions. 

1. The technical coding challenge was only SQL. Frankly in my 8 years of analytics, none of my peers use Python regularly unless their role is to automate or data engineering. Youre better off mastering SQL by using leetcode and DataLemur

2. Interviews at all the FAANGs are similar. Call with HR rep, first round is with 1 person and might be technical. Then a final round with a bunch of individual interviews on the same day. Most of the questions will be STAR format. 

3. As for my skillsets, I advertise myself as someone who can build strategy, project manage, and can do deep dive analyses. Im never going to compete against the recent grads and experts in ML/LLM/AI on technical skills, thats just an endless grind to stay at the top. I would strongly recommend others to sharpen their soft skills. A video I watched recently is from The Diary of a CEO with Body Language Expert with Vanessa Edwards. I legit used a few tips during my interviews and I thought that helped "
"For anyone looking to brush up on their SQL, I found that leetcode SQL50 and DataLemur and superior to any other sites out there. Both are free and took me about a month to get through them both. Practiced about 2 hours a day","['[DataLemur](https://datalemur.com/questions) founder here  appreciate the shoutout <3\n\nEdit: woow, lotta love below this  thank you to ~~my alt accounts~~ everyone, glad to know the site/book made a positive impact!', 'Did you apply to a product sense data scientist role?', 'Using a bit of sql at work but need to really get good at it.

Congrats!! Can I ask what is your experience level?,"['Im a director at one of the largest financial companies. Not a people leader, its just a job grade. I do have two masters and a few certs including AWS. Ill admit that my resume looks good on paper but the biggest challenge was getting someone to look at it.']"
"It felt like this week surpassed all of 2023 for me.

Prior to ""2020"" I don't recall such hiring floods in January.  Seems maybe people adjusted to a new normal? But also, hiring froze last year in March/April and then June, and the bottom fell out in August until December.  So, we'll see how this year progresses.

Companies usually hire in June so they can launch in fall, and they'll hire in March/April so they can launch in summer.  So there's another month and a half of opportunities after February until the summer lull.  But then after September, it's a downhill slip during the last quarter.  By October budgets are frozen solid for the next 6 months unless urgent.

How did people job hunt prior to July 2008?  I don't know of any January flood hiring prior to that time.  It's both a new and old hiring strategy.

What I would tell younger people is that there used to be Dec-17 to Feb-1 shut downs for wage work.  Companies usually started recruiting a month and a half ""after"" the holidays, and sometimes posting ads would pick up dramatically in March/April.  You also never knew how many people left jobs in December or got promoted in January, which opened up opportunities by March/April. But the ""official"" once a year hiring was definitely in the summer. Sometimes companies would hire in the fall for a ""holiday"" campaign for retail customers but that's not like January hiring now, which is a very recent thing.

Basically job agencies adjusted to the behavior of unemployment lines stretching around the corner in January or something, but nowhere did such a large amount of people search for jobs as in the past 6 years, or take time off to search for jobs as in the last 20 years.  So in some way things have changed profoundly. Not sure what.","[""Yeah, feb-april is best time for job hopping generally in a technical field. Annual budgets and headcount get approved and managers can finally open the role they've needed for the past 9 months.""]"

"1.

Second favorite language for data analytics purposes aside from Excel would be Python.

2. No, I have yet to work with a machine learning algorithm.

3. To ensure the accuracy of data I always make sure the data comes from the official repository and that it is as up-to-date as the system allows, ie. that either the automated process that pushed the data to the system or aggregator I use is functioning properly and timely or the team that manually suppllies the datasets has done so per the agreed upon terms. Upon receiving the data, I look for any outliers that may hint at loss of data integrity and compare the data set to historical data to make sure the expected trend is being followed. If there are any outliers, I do research on the systems/processes producing the data to determine whether there was some sort of adhoc event that triggered the fluctuation or if the data was indeed corrupted somehow. 

4. Correlation would be when there are two different trends or stories being told by the data that are related to one another in either a negative, positive or neutral way consistently. Causation is when one event is the actor and there is another event that triggers as a result and is completely dependent upon the first event. In the instance of causation the second event could occur on its own without the actor as described in the example actually triggering the event because they're not necessarily correlated 100% of the time. That's the best way I can think of the difference, although in many instances the two terms could very well be interchangeable.

5. I've never experienced a data breach professionally, but I wouldn't cover it up were I to experience one as that is not in compliance with any reputable firm's cyber security policy as it could expose the firm (or other firms business is being conducted with) to unnecessary risk and damage its reputation, incur costs in the way of either fines or expenses addressing the gaps in the infrastructure or security measures taken to ensure data remains secure. Additionally, it's immoral not to report a breach as it could expose clients, either internal or external, to risk themselvese.

6. Data privacy is ensured through the use of Identity and Access Management measures, appropriate fcyber security policies, encryption where appropriate, and effective training for all employees given access to information considered Confidential, Private, Secret, Top Secret, Special Access, etc. based on the type of organization retaining the data.  n 

7. I am honestly not familiar with then concept of overfitting data. 

8. I handle missing data values differently depending on the reason for its absence. If it looks as though there's an error because of a flaw in the system I raise the issue with the technology team responsible for fixing breaks. If it's a breach of data I would raise the issue with cyber security. If the missing data is literally just blank or null values it more than likely is supposed to be that way and means something specific, so I would look up the data dictionary and determine what it means.

9. The best example I can think of in reference to imbalanced data would be when two different repositories are keeping track of largely fhe same entities (operating systems or servers in this case) but are possibly not registering the same number of systems because the method of allocating a server to one line of business over another might vary per system or repository. One system could label an org as having ownership of the asset itself for instance, where another might view the owner of the primary application on the asset as also owning the server.

10. Some examples of supervised learning would be formally learning an agreed upon curriculum either through enrolling in courses at a university, certificate program, or other schooling or possibly through a training program at you work. Unsupervised learning is material that you teach yourself, usually in isolation, but could also be done in a group setting if everyone was researching and trialing/erroring the information in an attempt to learn what they deem to be important about the topic for their purposes and in an order such that it would allow them to digest all of the remaining information on the topic as needed, once their baseline understanding of the topic was solidified. They're not the same thing and what works best for one person may not be best for another.",['Jesus Christ you remind me of me exactly 3 years ago.']

If you have missing data for something like emails, but you have 20000 rows of customer sales data and maybe 200 of them are just missing data, maybe those 200 are your companies weird dumb way of doing vendor transactions or something equally inane, so factoring in sources of revenue should require that you know the removal of these missing records will not damage the overall scope of the investigation later on.

Maybe those 200 missing data rows had $30,000 each transaction while the average transaction for the other 20000 is just $100.

"So

You have 10200 rows of data

200 of them are unclean

Your initial comment I believe was suggesting using the isnull to -Drop- those rows of data?

Because, null isn't really a value itself it's more of an absence of anything.

If the missing values are normally categorical or strings, you can impute a new string such as N/A

If they are numerical it is more tricky; can your dataset afford to impute them by predictions and regression? Will that severely impact the model?

Etc.

But just because a row has a missing value for email, doesn't just automatically mean whack the data.

That's ignorance. If you drop something, you had better contain a very solid idea of what impact it will have, and to first quantify impact you generally proceed with building things and remove/add it to see how it changes the game.

If it doesn't at all, just kill them. Not worth dealing with.

If they account for a significance, or are the difference in your pval threshold, you need to take them seriously and grind out a resolution for the missing values that doesn't involve just dropping and pretending like the rows don't exist.

Hi,

My girlfriend is a 22 year old university student passionate about data science, and she just posted my first article on Medium using Machine-Learning (that took her months of research and coding to put together). Her post only has about 500 views, but to her surprise today a reddit user called [**Dean-Hoffman**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dean-Hoffman/) **posted a link to his own data science company where he copy-pasted her article.** He didn't contact her about reposting it, didn't give her proper credit and **ridiculously added a ""Contact Data Scientist"" at the end with his name on it**. On the article, he clearly stated he is the author in multiple locations. This is the ""Data Science"" company that links from the article on his website: [https://www.actionablelabs.com/](https://www.actionablelabs.com/)

Apparently the guy Dean Hoffman is the ""founder"" of the company and refers to himself on the About Us as **""offering the highest commitment to excellence, personal integrity, and business ethics.""**

Update: Hey, this is the girlfriend that wrote the article. First of all, thank you all that made the time to reply, research and help me find answers. It's really appreciated.  So far, this is what we know about this person (or people):

\- This website has been stealing hundreds, if not thousands, of data science projects and articles from legitimate data scientists and writers.

\- The stolen content website in definitely bot-operated as the owner posts dozens of articles a day, completely copy+paste, mainly from Medium, TechCrunch and Towards Data Science.

\- It's confirmed that Dean-Hoffman from the Linkedin that links from his company (Actionable Labs) is a real person and the same Dean-Hoffman that is stealing content and running a data company.

\- If you go on his linkedin, under ""Data Scientist - Pennsylvania Department of General Services"" you will find that he mentions ""Actionable Insights"" (the stolen content website) in one of his experiences. Completely absurd.

UPDATE 2: Medium and TDS unfortunately can't do much for me individually as the authors are the ones who own the rights to the articles. TDS will try to reach out to the owner and ask them to take the posts down. I hope they see that their whole website is being copied, which would most likely infringe their TOS.

Please don't comment anything that contains the words ""copyright"", ""infringement"" or related words on her article as it may trigger keyword algorithms that delete copyrighted articles posted to Medium (and thus could have her article deleted). Thank you!

At any given time, who are the top 10 richest people in the world -- in terms of raw billions of $ -- out of dozens and dozens of possible options. Using a single line for each person is going to be illegible and laborious to look up in a legend with dozens of entries. A line graph would also obscure this goal, considering we *only* care about the top 10 richest, not people 11-500. There's no way anyone would advocate for a line graph with 40-60 different legend entries.\n\n2. What is the distribution of wealth of the top 10 richest, or how do the top 10 proportionally relate to one another. A line graph will need a single overall scale, unless we want to transform the axes and obscure the interpretation. This will obscure the distributions in earlier years where the absolute differences in wealth are smaller. We can use an inset for a single window of time but not for *all* windows of time, which is what the scrolling bar graph does. \n\n3. How are individual billionaires' net worths changing over small periods of time. A 2d line graph makes it difficult to measure year-over-year changes since you have to draw an imaginary line and interpolate using the axes or gridlines, which gets really laborious when you need to do it for 10 different entries many times in a row. \n\nHow do you intend to use an inset for every single 2-3 year window? Faceting is out of the window, and plotting additional lines (like derivatives) is only going to exacerbate the issues raised above. \n\nDo animated bar graphs work well for every use case?

Number one would be a tie between *'A Pragmatic Programmer'* and *'Clean Code'* by Andrew Hunt, David Thomas, and Martin C Martin respectfully. They both focus on good habits to develop as a developer. Things like variable naming, proper exception handling, when and how to comment. Things like that you cant learn in a programming course.

Although these are not needed for my current job, I plan on pursing a Masters in Data Analytics, so  Number 2 would be *ORIELLY 'Data Science Handbook by 'Jake Vanderclass', 'SPRINGER An Introduction to Statistical Learning', and Hands on Machine Learning with Sci-Kit Learn and Tensorflow' - Aurelien Geron.* I'm very interested in Data Science, and plan on getting my masters on  Data Analyse.

A subset of the data might have different performance. Let\'s say your model is predicting something about people who live in a certain US state. It may have good performance in certain cities, bad performance in others.\n2. To extend the 2d spatial metaphor, a model is a discriminator that generates solution boundaries in a space. The boundary separates positives and negatives. The closer you can fit your model to the boundaries of the solution space, the better it performs. Having a tight net matching a smaller area with concentrated fish works better intuitively. Ideally, you have an adjustable net and high resolution mapping of the lake showing exactly where the fish (and rocks) are. The ""high resolution mapping"" could equate to more data rows, allowing your solution boundaries (net size and shape) to be intricate (as generated by the ML model), perfectly capturing the fish and avoiding the rocks.', ""Let's change to a marketing example.\n\nYou want to spend your marketing dollars to target potential customers.

But how is this related to ranking?,"[""If the fish are all at one end of the lake (i.e. highest ranked 'things') then it's much easier to find a lot of fish quicker. If ROC AUC score is low then the ranking is poor and so you find too many trash cans at the 'fish end' of the lake.""]"
"Accuracy would be the total correct classifications out of the total observations. I believe in this case, that would mean the number of fish in the net and the number of rocks remaining in the lake after the net is pulled in divided by the total number of fish and rocks. 

We don't know how many rocks are in the lake but lets pretend it's 500. That would give us 80 fish caught (true positives) and 420 rocks not captured (true negatives) out of 100 fish and 500 rocks.

(80 + 420) / (100 + 500) = 83% accuracy

This is good example of why precision and recall don't give you the full picture. If there were only 80 rocks in the lake total, you would still have 80% recall and 50% precision. The logical conclusion is that your net is good at catching fish but not so good at avoiding rocks. What you wouldnt know is that your net is insanely adept at picking up rocks and youd be better if marketing it as a rock removal tool than a fishing net. 

They're fine metrics when your positives and negatives are both well represented but for heavily imbalanced datasets, they can paint a misleading picture.","[""They are widely used in scenarios when number of true negatives is unknown or can't be even defined, for example in image detection.

"> How do you manage a pushy stakeholder?

I'm a SWE, not a data scientist, but my answer for a case like this is quite simple.

Me: ""I'm struggling to meet the demands here. My understanding is that this is a very important and high priority initiative, is that right?""

Stakeholder: ""Yes, it's very high priority and urgent.""

Me: ""So why am I the only person who's working on it? Can we get more resources?""

Then the stakeholder is forced to either backtrack and admit that the urgency and priority isn't as high as they're making it out to be, or else is forced up the chain of command to provide additional resources.

Company - says they support work/life balance.


Gives work that takes 14 hours while claiming it takes 7.


Struggle and go to manager - instant performance issues.


Suffer in silence - company gets what they want, cheap labour.

So coaching, guidance, support, and direction are often absent. The non-technical manager thus fails to produce value in workstreams and deliverables more often then not, and points to either limitations with the data, or with the team.

There are also subtle ways to ask about culture. IMO that stuff is almost as important, or more important, than the actual company name, unless you're at a FAANG / good resume name. \n\nJust so you know, tech and DS allows for a lot of jumping, so for your first role, I wouldn't get too hung up. Hopefully you land something good, otherwise jump ship when you can line something else up. \n\nWhen it comes to spotify specifically, I haven't heard a ton about their culture, but as someone who's worked in music, I'll say the industry itself is tough. There's a lot of money being paid out to people, and yet it feels like no one is making substantial money, except I guess maybe the record labels. More streaming (aka growth) = more royalties to be paid, and more growth for Spotify = more money for the labels to ask for a larger portion of. That's probably why Spotify is doing the big podcast bet, and also audiobooks now. Just my two cents on that end. Don't want to discourage you, but it's just the reality of music :/ (edit: i will add, there are other DS jobs in music, they might net less money and/or less prestige. otherwise, the other major streamers could also be options since many have other income).""]"

can you elaborate on the political cover part?,"['Yes. The common advice for ""stakeholder management"" is various ways of saying ""No"" and/or advice about project management. However I feel that this is just a small part of what stakeholder management actually is. In my experience doing stakeholder management WELL is actually more about the ART of understanding the politics of your own position in relation to the politics of the company/organization as a whole. Once you understand that you can develop the relationships you need in order to effectively manage your workload (by saying No/de-prioritization or ignoring requests). The reason I call it an art is because there\'s no one-size-fits-all way of doing this. It\'s entirely context-dependent and is about understanding who is asking for something, what level of power they hold, and who you need to be on your side (""cover you"") if and when you have to say No. \n\nFor more junior people, the key relationships are probably their own manager and (probably more effectively) their manager\'s manager. For more senior people, it usually becomes more about creating relationships with the most senior cross-functional people you can. This is all has to be done ahead of time. In other words: Saying No to people will almost for sure piss them off to some extent and the goal here is to PREEMPT THEM by using the hierarchy of the organization to your own leverage. Like the best circumstance is when people are pissed off at you but they barely even bother to pursue it because they know it\'s already a lost situation for them. \n\nOf course: as a junior person this is much more challenging when your own leaders don\'t do this themselves. I\'ve found as a manager it\'s vital for me to do all of this to protect peoples\' time. There are also certainly circumstances where the culture of the company/org is to just grind everyone to dust and it\'s very hard to get around that but I\'d argue those are the situations where you get the experience and money you need from the role and then get out of there ASAP (which it sounds like basically what happened to the woman who made the Youtube video).']"

IMO the best play in these situations is not to bristle, but try and reflect the stakeholder's excitement and commitment to success on the project, work hard (but not so hard you burn yourself out), but be realistic about the fact that you're just one person and that's going to make it possibly slower than they'd hope.

"If you're applying to jobs, I'd cast a wide net right now, just because tech is kinda in a tough spot. I think a lot of companies are figuring out they have to strategize their spend better in the current environment, some doing better than others. I'd take the interview experience as a chance to get to see who your manager would be, what they're working on, what tech they're using, why they need you. There are also subtle ways to ask about culture. IMO that stuff is almost as important, or more important, than the actual company name, unless you're at a FAANG / good resume name. 

Just so you know, tech and DS allows for a lot of jumping, so for your first role, I wouldn't get too hung up. Hopefully you land something good, otherwise jump ship when you can line something else up. 

When it comes to spotify specifically, I haven't heard a ton about their culture, but as someone who's worked in music, I'll say the industry itself is tough. There's a lot of money being paid out to people, and yet it feels like no one is making substantial money, except I guess maybe the record labels. More streaming (aka growth) = more royalties to be paid, and more growth for Spotify = more money for the labels to ask for a larger portion of. That's probably why Spotify is doing the big podcast bet, and also audiobooks now. Just my two cents on that end. Don't want to discourage you, but it's just the reality of music :/ (edit: i will add, there are other DS jobs in music, they might net less money and/or less prestige. otherwise, the other major streamers could also be options since many have other income).","['Ah I see. Yeah that makes sense. Yeah I mean my current gig is good, but Im only a year or so in and I feel as though I could jump ship while Im still early.

"Standup every day for both teams.  Both teams on 2 week sprints (not my choice, entire dept did this).

Two stand-ups each day.  Two grooming sessions each week for 2 teams (4 total sessions).  2 demos every 2 weeks.  2 retros every 2 weeks.  2 refinements with sprint kick-off every 2 weeks.

I was also Scrum of Scrum for a large project (moving data from a data center - we had an entire facility just for data - to the cloud (AWS).  These meetings were 1 hour every week.  14 SMs giving updates.

Scrum stuff was in the morning because half the team was in India.  Other half in US.  Morning worked best.  Between both teams, 1 hour each day for stand-ups.  2 hours some days if it was refinement, retro, or demo.

"Yes. The common advice for ""stakeholder management"" is various ways of saying ""No"" and/or advice about project management. However I feel that this is just a small part of what stakeholder management actually is. In my experience doing stakeholder management WELL is actually more about the ART of understanding the politics of your own position in relation to the politics of the company/organization as a whole. Once you understand that you can develop the relationships you need in order to effectively manage your workload (by saying No/de-prioritization or ignoring requests). The reason I call it an art is because there's no one-size-fits-all way of doing this. It's entirely context-dependent and is about understanding who is asking for something, what level of power they hold, and who you need to be on your side (""cover you"") if and when you have to say No. 

For more junior people, the key relationships are probably their own manager and (probably more effectively) their manager's manager. For more senior people, it usually becomes more about creating relationships with the most senior cross-functional people you can. This is all has to be done ahead of time. In other words: Saying No to people will almost for sure piss them off to some extent and the goal here is to PREEMPT THEM by using the hierarchy of the organization to your own leverage. Like the best circumstance is when people are pissed off at you but they barely even bother to pursue it because they know it's already a lost situation for them. 

Of course: as a junior person this is much more challenging when your own leaders don't do this themselves. I've found as a manager it's vital for me to do all of this to protect peoples' time. There are also certainly circumstances where the culture of the company/org is to just grind everyone to dust and it's very hard to get around that but I'd argue those are the situations where you get the experience and money you need from the role and then get out of there ASAP (which it sounds like basically what happened to the woman who made the Youtube video).","['Another name for this is politics, in the good sense of the word. Politics is really nothing more than the art and science of managing relationships. It gets an evil connotation because so many people use politics for evil purposes rather than good purposes. In this context, good purposes are getting things done in a large organization and avoiding situations like this young woman found herself in.']"

So then if I legit just told them that its gonna take longer cause of lack of support xyz thats the best I can do? Last thing I want is stakeholders thinking data scientists are their numbers bitch expected to give them reports whenever,"['I think _how_ you say it is critically important.

"Do you live in a bubble or are you just stupid?

There are millions of bone fractures in the US annually. I dont know a single person who hasnt had a bone fracture of some degree.

While sting ray stings are rare, the point is that some trivial stinging animal encounter could result in multiple thousands of dollars of medical expenses. (And seeing one is not rare unless you are some bumbling Midwest trump supporter who never goes tot the coast). I could make the same point with wasp/bee stings, caterpillars, or even plant related rashes.

The point is that you will eventually incur a huge medical expense in your life. Maybe not in your 20s. Maybe not your 30s. But one day your weak ass bones from sitting in a chair and typing all day are going to crack. Your liver is going to revolt from all those shitty energy drinks. Or your doctor is going to find a polyp or lump where it shouldnt be, and youll be subject to rounds of chemo and surgeries that will easily max out your deductible. If you make it far enough, your brain will stop functioning and youll have to fall back on your kids insurance as their dependent (assuming you had any) or just lose your job and have to piss your retirement funds away to stay alive until they kick you to the curb.

Results of my first data science job search. Some insight in the comments.,nan
"I am an ABD PhD student who decided to transition into a data science-related position in industry. My field of study is heavy in statistics and optimization and I have 3 years of research experience in machine learning. I started applying for jobs on 4/21, primarily targeting Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer positions at non-MANGA companies. I accepted an offer yesterday. Here are some observations I had throughout the process that may be helpful for other job seekers:

\- I never got a single response from MANGA, even with referrals for several positions

\- I got several phone screens for positions which wanted 3+ years of industry experience, despite having 0. The recruiters for these positions seemed like they were having a hard time finding candidates, use this to your advantage.

\- Just mentioning that I had existing offers/other interviews scheduled to the recruiter would usually let me bypass stages of the interview process. Both of the offers I got resulted from this tactic. Don't be afraid to namedrop fancy companies, if you can.

\- The offer that I declined had a substantial on-call component to the job, but the job posting/recruiter NEVER mentioned this. If I hadn't specifically asked during a team fit call after the offer was made, they would have never told me. Be sure to ask lots of probing questions when you talk to the hiring manager/team you would join.

\- My communication was cited as one of the decisive factors leading to my offers. While technical skills are important, I got the impression that communication was highly valued at most of the companies I talked to. Don't neglect that skillset.

Edit: I wanted to clarify that I am NOT finishing my PhD. I am leaving the program after 3 years with only a masters degree.","['> I got several phone screens for positions which wanted 3+ years of industry experience, despite having 0. \n\nJust wanted to share that my team has 6 levels for DS roles. \n\n- DS I is for entry level candidates with a bachelors \n\n- DS II is for candidates with 1-2 years experience or entry level with a masters\n\n- DS III is for candidates with 3-5 years, or masters + 1-2 years, or entry level PhD candidates \n\nI assume other companies are similar.', '>Just mentioning that I had existing offers/other interviews scheduled to the recruiter would usually let me bypass stages of the interview process\n\nSuper cool to see FOMO get results in the recruiting process!', 'Could you speak more specifically about the last point?

"I have seen a few of these posts and feel a bit bewildered by the sheer volume that is usually involved in peoples searches. I am a senior undergraduate in a data science major which was somewhat of a cross between biology and computer science / data science skills and am wondering how much these posts are the rule in the world of jobs with data science titles, and how much these are just exceptional cases which folks enjoy reporting upon? 

It seems absurd to do 100+ apps in my mind. Maybe there is no way to avoid that, but usually when I have applied to positions in the past (in different industries and at totally different skill levels) I get responses from just about everyone, and have a substantially higher ratio of offers to interviews, and generally just less unresponsiveness. 

Is it possible some folks are maybe taking a too-rapid-fire approach to this process? Or is it really going to look like this no matter how good you are at vetting good from bad options early on? 

Did you do a lot of specific tailoring of your resume or cover letter for these places you applied? Did you try and meet their specific language based criteria in whatever material of yours they see as a first look? 

I think I just want to understand how likely I am to be in a similar long search position post graduation and would appreciate any perspective others can offer.

I agree that if background factors allow, pushing through bad analysis is better than no data. Just like getting bad instructions from your boss is better than no instructions, because at least there's evidence for your decisions, even if wrong. You can blame the analysis instead of whoever made the decision.

"The Key Word in Data Science is Science, not Data","I know reddit doesn't represent real life, but just look at the titles of this sub. They're all about tools, code languages/packages, and algorithms. I think to most aspiring data scientists, that's how they see the profession. You're given a tech stack, some data, and your goal is to apply x tool/algorithm to y data. My argument is this is only going to work at super junior levels, and I believe it's the reason why there's a huge oversupply of junior data scientists but teams still can't find competent seniors.  


As another experiment, just head over to r/dataisbeautiful right now. You'll see a ton of different techs used to generate some decent and some awful visualizations. All of those people were able to access, clean, and plot data. There's no shortage of people who can do that. But what you'll notice if you read that sub, is there's a huge lack of people thinking critically about the data they're working with, and that's the science aspect.

&#x200B;

I feel like every week there's a new topic here on how long until data scientists are obsolete. I don't think data scientists are getting less valuable, but people who can just use tool x to leverage data y are. Why would I hire a senior data scientist to create a dashboard when I can teach an intern tableau and get 95% of the same thing? Whether it's recognizing Simpson's paradox, knowing when to keep/stop digging into research questions, figuring out when gathering more data is necessary, knowing how to communicate findings in ways that make an impact, the science part of data science is by far the most valuable. Some people call them soft skills, but I'm not a huge fan of the term. It's science. Unfortunately these are the toughest skills to learn and also the toughest skills to interview for, so I don't suspect you'll see companies steering away from technical questions in interviews any time soon. But mastering the science aspect of data science is I believe the best way to make yourself extremely valuable."
"I can't tell you how many times I've backed out of writing up this same post for fear of being downvoted to oblivion.

All of the joy comes in experimental design, figuring out interesting ways of measuring something and coming to a better understanding of a process (sometimes involving building a model!)."", 'To be fair most organizations arent doing the science part and even in academia for ML the science part is super loose (comparison between challenger ideas with estimates of variance to see if the result is just chance).\n\nSome of us are jaded and just roll our eyes at the science part .

People keep saying that the DS role is obsolete because it is, what the role used to mean barely exists today ( there are still research teams but I think most businesses understand that is not what they need ) now there are tons of practitioners and everything has become very obstructed in the same way that new software languages have (like react)\n\nThe tools don't just make the scientist better, they lower the bar for what it means to be a scientist.\n\nIn your example id argue there is very little difference between a newb with an amazing hammer and a craftsman with a hammer in 99% of DS situations (with again research teams bieng the exception)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat we do isn't hard and I think people need to realize that"", ""I work in data science and I love the carpentry analogy, it is one I use quite often.

"It is also important to understand what that ""science"" thing means.  It means is applying the scientific method to improve understanding.

The steps to the Scientific Method are:


1) Pose a Testable Question.
  
2) Conduct Background Research.
  
3) State your Hypothesis.
  
4) Design Experiment.
  
5) Perform your Experiment.
  
6) Collect Data.
  
7) Draw Conclusions.
  
8) Publish Findings (optional).

You also are NOT trying to prove the hypothesis.  Let the facts speak for themselves and getting a clear example that invalidates a hypothesis is a powerful way to improve understanding.","[""Since most data science is not done in academia, I think step 8 should be more sharing your findings with coworkers (or testers/auditors if you have them) and asking them to poke holes in your methodology and conclusions in a way similar to how publishing does with journals. This is especially important with regards to Simpson's paradox and finding the true causation rather than finding simple correlations. Peer review and criticism is one of the most important parts of the scientific method."", 'I would argue this isnt emblematic of a lot of academic research of data science. A lot of science isnt hypothesis-driven but involves just observational work that leads to insights. Experiments arent designed for every paper and in fact most papers did not come about via the scientific method but that doesnt mean they arent rigorous or important.', 'Depending on the environment, there is one more aspect that IMHO is often underrepresented or missed: 9. Explaining Experiment/Result (optional)\n\nWhat I mean with this is ""8. Publish Findings"" tends IMHO to focus typically on informing fellow data science experts and asking them for review, aka opening a discussion about the steps taken. While explaining results to a wider or specific audience requires boiling it down or tailoring the information to the background of the audience.', 'Science does not mean ""the scientific method."" In fact that\'s not how you do science.\n\nThe *real* way people do science is:\n\n1) Look around for something interesting\n\n2) Read literature\n\n4) Publish paper\n\n5) Apply for funding, if no funding go back to step 1\n\n6) Collect data\n\n7) Analyze data\n\n8) Get results\n\n9) Publish paper\n\n10) Apply for funding, if no funding go back to step 1\n\n11) Design preliminary study\n\n12) Collect data\n\n13) Analyze data\n\n14) Get results\n\n15) Publish paper\n\n16) Apply for funding, if no funding go back to step 1\n\n17) Form a hypothesis\n\n18) Design the real study & experiment\n\n19) Publish a paper\n\n20) Apply for funding, if no funding go back to step 1\n\n21) Conduct the experiment\n\n22) Collect data\n\n23) Analyze data\n\n24) Get results\n\n25) Publish paper\n\nIt takes **years** of research to even form a hypothesis that hasn\'t been done before (incremental salami research in trash journals) and is actually interesting.\n\nThe reason why everyone parades around ""the scientific method"" was because during renaissance we had a lot of low hanging fruits like ""I let go of the apple and it will fall down"" which doesn\'t take a lot of imagination nor there was a large volume of research that has already been done. It never really was the way people do science and it\'s just some stuff some randoms will tell you on the science channel.\n\nAnd this is just empirical research which is pretty rare. Most research is not empirical. Even physics is mostly math and computer simulations nowadays and you don\'t really do hypothesis type of thing either because it\'s formal proofs you\'re after and mostly ""throw shit at the wall until something sticks"".\n\nThis type of confirmatory empirical research is basically dead.. It\'s the very final step in like drug research. Pretty much most research never reaches that stage because nobody is going to fund you to beat a dead horse that has 10 papers written about it already. Most things don\'t need to be confirmed with a formal study where you make a formal hypothesis and design the study to test it because that ""thing"" has no value and basic research ends there. Most published papers are describing an idea and providing some evidence that suggests that there might be something. They very rarely advance to the confirmatory research stage because the idea isn\'t worth the money.\n\nI have a PhD in ML and I did 0 empirical research and ""hypothesis"" or ""experiment"" is not mentioned once in any of my papers (top conferences) or my dissertation (got great marks for it and even won some awards). I literally get paid to do science for a living and I haven\'t used the word hypothesis since like highschool biology.', 'Exactly.\n\nHowever, I think a key part of science reporting should always be making it accessible, and meaningful. \n\nPresenting it in a way that makes sense to the layman. \n\nTelling a story.

"Agree in part, but most of the analytics problems that people are faced with don't require sophisticated modeling techniques or advanced stats knowledge, or even advanced database knowledge. The vast majority of business problems and ""insights"" can be garnered from merging/joining disparate data, cleaning that data, and filtering/sorting afterward to answer specific questions.

There's a lot of overkill in trying to fix relatively simple problems with overly complex methods and tools, because business leaders and managers don't really know how to address the issues with the analytics resources they have. Newer analytics professionals have been taught all this theory and their applied knowledge stems from having nice and neat use cases with perfect data, the right tools to use, and clearly defined objects ... which is hardly how things work in the real world.","['Hard agree.

Another poster below did a great job of outlining the scientific method; this and a more broad understanding of how to apply it is useful in any situation, including to someone doing simpler descriptive analytics, as they allow an analyst to propose next steps and identify testable hypotheses.']"

Im not sure if thats just due to company politics, or if Im not in the part of my career where Im senior enough to dive into these problems.

- How can I show scientific thinking on my resume? How can I gauge scientific thinking in interviews? I think this can partially be addressed by building a portfolio to document the analytical approach I designed for any starting problems but companies seem to only care about what they can get out of data science vs. the whys in data science. They also just dont care about the portfolio because work experience is more important. I can build a dashboard with the ideal technical architecture but I wouldnt know how I can show the value of choose technical design decision A vs B. 

These two points make me very confused in figuring out the best strategy to move forward in my data science career. I am a pure mathematician in training, and its been frustrating (still is) to really not use the scientific thinking I wanted to bring in my data science career due to factors completely out of my control. Its also frustrating when theres no clear solution how to show it or gauge it as well. Ive tried asking my network for advice and thoughts and unfortunately no one knows or even understands what I mean by scientific thinking",['Try biotech. Youll have to deal with biologists but its one of the few (potentially) profitable industries with real science required.']
"I work with two types of data scientists: physical science PhDs with ~10 years of industry experience and whip-smart junior coders with more of a CS background.

The old-school data scientists come up with the most creative approaches. They approach each problem differently, they take the time in understanding the data and its limitations before working their way up to building a model. Their models might not be terribly exciting, but they can explain every last detail of theory behind the model and why it's appropriate.

Conversely, most of the junior data scientists want to turn around as many models as possible in as short a time as they can. Every problem they're given ends up shoved in to an xgboost or scikit-learn model within hours of getting their hands on the data. They program functions to test many different types of models and then evaluate the performance to pick a ""winner."" When they're given a forecasting project, they focus their whole document praising prophet and then processing the data wholesale.

There's a middle ground. The old-school guys sneer at terms like AI and ML. The younger set takes data at face value and treats xgboost like a data science panacea. 

It's important not to completely close yourself off from some of the more ""turnkey"" packages and libraries that are becoming available, but it's **far** more important to be intellectually curious about how they work and what they're actually doing with your data.","[""Yeah our company has one team that develops the models, mostly old school data scientists, and the team that puts them in production, my team, which is mostly people with more tech skills. My role is sort of in communicating between the teams so when the model developer uses data that isn't available in production I need to explain to them what's available and when imputing will work or not (if the most important right-hand variable is a-b and we have to impute b based on a in production, you're going to have a bad time). \n\nBut then on the other side more junior members of my team will just have no curiosity whatsoever and will just code what's assigned to them and when asked about a model output difference will respond with giant datasets and/or programming lingo. That's kind of what prompted this post. Part of my job is to also mentor our junior analysts and get them asking the right questions and developing that curiosity. It's hard though. I keep trying to stress empathy with the business. If you tell the business variable x is different and here's an excel dump they're not going to gain anything. If however you can explain how variable x is derived, what the business importance is, and the general trend that's contributing to x changing, there's your value.""]"

I equate the ""science"" of data science to be analogous to statistics.

Statistics. And statistics. One course won't get you there either btw. One key concept is understanding the assumptions of your model. A lot of people don't even recognize that their models are making assumptions, let alone analyze them. The way you model creates certain biases and assumptions. The data you use has certain biases and makes certain assumptions (e.g. maybe you assume no black swans). You should continuously be doubting your model and your data.

"tbh in the real world, using and optimizing tool usage is a much higher productivity increase than optimizing the science.

Nowadays, building a model is much easier than actually deploying it to production.","[""In this context I'd say the science part is building a good model. That includes looking for which data to measure and collect, the ability to come up with the idea of using a data-driven model to solve the business problem, establishing a hypothesis, figuring out true causation upon having data.\n\nI'll give a good example at a previous job. We wanted to estimate how much a house would sell for, and we had pretty meh data in terms of important variables. But on paper we constructed a very predictive model, the #1 predictive variable was the list price. This model was in production before my manager said wait a minute, the true driver of house price isn't actually listing price, otherwise people could always sell their crappy house by just listing it higher. We ended up going through a vendor and purchasing mls data that included hundreds of fields. We then were able to construct a model that had what we thought were better predictors of how much the house would sell for. \n\nAnd it wasn't as predictive as the previous one, and we determined that actually since people selling houses didn't have an incentive to have our model spit out a higher predicted price, we were fine with the old model. But we knew that we were actually modeling based on seller behavior, we had researched alternatives, and were comfortable making what we thought was a correct decision to have the right hand side variable be what the seller listed the house at. We also know what we need to monitor for potential model deterioration.\n\nIs getting a model into production a walk in the park? Not at all, but I'd argue that people who can work through the previous problem are rarer and more valuable than people who can put a model into production."", ""this is kind of where i am at - though i'm no professional (i took a 9 month boot camp only) i have some ideas on models that i can train and try for my purposes (HVAC predictive analytics, i hope...) but once i have results, i have no idea how to deploy it into production!""]"
"No. Science is about reproducibility and the ability to falsify hypotheses.

Soft skills help, but they help in every field.

Data Science in general is terrible at reproducibility because tools like jupyter notebook don't allow it (because cells can be executed in arbitrary order and displayed results could rely on deleted state), and it's a mission to get data scientists to use version control for code, let alone data.

Tools matter 100% to ensuring the science part is carried out correctly.","['Data science isn\'t by definition irreproducible. What you\'re describing is just terrible data science.

"Unpopular opinion: 

My view and experience in the business world has some similarities as yours, with my conclusions being very different. Data Science is the act and art of applying scientific algorithms and methods to data in depths and time frames impossible to humans. Each company defines the scope and definition of business success. Value propositions for company and customer are almost always equal. Citizen and junior data scientists are quick to apply the next shiny framework, algorithm, library or technique in their attempts to find success without having to use the scientific method to study the data and solve thoughtful problems. Conflict in quality commonly comes from the company when they want to announce some new buzzword in production, and when they are willing to accept poor quality for the sake of Sales/Marketing. Shiny frameworks and libraries are applied half hazardly, data is poorly understood, and poor results updated on next release. The academic nature of senior data scientists shunned. These conflicts will continue to erode the field as it relates to the business world. 

I agree that data scientists need to speak to customer value in a way that the customer stakeholder is able to see rubber-hitting-the-road value. This is an under appreciated but supremely superior skill. One that should be a primary skill set of a senior scientist. Value created needs to be equally value communicated in the customers on terms. 

Lastly I would suggest that data scientists need to be less academy and more application. A common ratio of R&D at mature companies is 80% application of science and 20% research. Most data scientists I know and have worked with would do themselves and their profession a great service by practicing applied data science and save the academics for their off time.

Edit 1: on mobile, spell check bit me. I meant applied vs application in the manner of applied mathematics rather than theoretical. Apologies for any confusion.","['I think you misunderstood what I meant. When you do ""application"", how do you approach what you\'re doing? Do you have a boss who tells you exactly what functions to code? Or do you use critical thinking and problem-solving capability to figure out how to best solve the business problem? Have you ever had someone think you should do x and you pointed out that y would be more efficient and solve the problem better?\n\nAs an example, we recently acquired another company and were working to integrate their data into our production models. Many people took their job as a simple mapping exercise and didn\'t think about which variables were used in the models, which imputations would cause issues, how the imputations would impact calculated model variables, etc. This project would almost definitely be counted as application, but there\'s a lot of science and critical thinking involved that many people in the industry don\'t do.']"
"I really couldn't agree more with OP.

I think the laser focus on modelling in data science communities is frankly bizarre. Some people seem to have the impression that if you aren't using machine learning tools somehow it isn't really data science.

I have a very hard time relating to this attitude. Model training is a chore, it's very rarely the interesting part of a problem.

"i disagree almost completely. About 7-10 years ago, data scientists used to justify their salary because you were building these highly complex models with very little 3rd party support (like Caffe era) .

The tools don't just make the scientist better, they lower the bar for what it means to be a scientist.

It takes **years** of research to even form a hypothesis that hasn't been done before (incremental salami research in trash journals) and is actually interesting.

The reason why everyone parades around ""the scientific method"" was because during renaissance we had a lot of low hanging fruits like ""I let go of the apple and it will fall down"" which doesn't take a lot of imagination nor there was a large volume of research that has already been done. It never really was the way people do science and it's just some stuff some randoms will tell you on the science channel.

And this is just empirical research which is pretty rare. Most research is not empirical. Even physics is mostly math and computer simulations nowadays and you don't really do hypothesis type of thing either because it's formal proofs you're after and mostly ""throw shit at the wall until something sticks"".

This type of confirmatory empirical research is basically dead.. It's the very final step in like drug research. Pretty much most research never reaches that stage because nobody is going to fund you to beat a dead horse that has 10 papers written about it already. Most things don't need to be confirmed with a formal study where you make a formal hypothesis and design the study to test it because that ""thing"" has no value and basic research ends there. Most published papers are describing an idea and providing some evidence that suggests that there might be something. They very rarely advance to the confirmatory research stage because the idea isn't worth the money.

I have a PhD in ML and I did 0 empirical research and ""hypothesis"" or ""experiment"" is not mentioned once in any of my papers (top conferences) or my dissertation (got great marks for it and even won some awards). I literally get paid to do science for a living and I haven't used the word hypothesis since like highschool biology.","['This has got to be the funniest comment I read all day... and it is in r/datascience!\n\nWould make for a good sitcom like The Office, only set in a research lab.', '\n>And this is just empirical research which is pretty rare.

"I think you misunderstood what I meant. When you do ""application"", how do you approach what you're doing? Do you have a boss who tells you exactly what functions to code? Or do you use critical thinking and problem-solving capability to figure out how to best solve the business problem? Have you ever had someone think you should do x and you pointed out that y would be more efficient and solve the problem better?

As an example, we recently acquired another company and were working to integrate their data into our production models. Many people took their job as a simple mapping exercise and didn't think about which variables were used in the models, which imputations would cause issues, how the imputations would impact calculated model variables, etc. This project would almost definitely be counted as application, but there's a lot of science and critical thinking involved that many people in the industry don't do.","['All the time, and far too frequently, the mandated code/results make no sense and are sometimes indefensible. \n\nThe data problem is 90% of life, despite how cliche that sounds.

"I agree. Too much time is spent on model *building*, and not enough time is spent on model *identification*.

Model identification is the first step, and I think it's also the most important.

It's the step that requires the most creative effort, and many problems require nuanced solutions. 

If you're even a little off, wild end results ensue, and a true QA of a biased model would require you to completely scrap lots of precious work hours.","['100% yes.

">The tools don't just make the scientist better, they lower the bar for what it means to be a scientist.

This argument is akin to saying that GUI stats software programs like SPSS lowered the bar for what it means to be a statistician, when really they just lowered the bar for who is able to run an ANOVA, etc. There's a difference between being able to use a tool and understanding why a tool should or should not be used. Just being able to hammer a nail and saw a board doesn't make someone a master carpenter.

I agree that running canned code for a statistical model or mathematical technique that someone else developed decades ago (and that someone else optimized code for years ago) is not that hard. But I think the point of OP's post is that if that's all you're doing then you're more of a data technician than a data scientist.

It is true that in the beginning, most Data Scientists (not all) stood out from all other data-related specialties mainly because of their technical skills and deeper knowledge of statistics. Not because of a better understanding of business problems. Today, when those tools are easier to use, and Data Analysts, even tech-savvy business users are able to apply them, it became more visible (again) that domain knowledge, understanding of the business processes/problems are much more important skills. And yes, many of those ""Data Scientists"" that learned how to code in python/R and few models, definitely became obsolete.

"The hardest part of the job is convincing higher ups to give you the time and resources to actually conduct studies, then going on to convince them that the results were worthy of the resource spending.

In essence, I'd say that regardless of the tools you use, conducting research in a role that companies don't recognize as a position to conduct research requires a lot more than just science. This is the hardest the part in actuality. It's resisting the trend away from science when the goal is still truly scientific research.

The best data scientists are able to convince those who have no idea what the difference between software development and data science that the data science position is an important research position.

Actually, I'd say that's what it takes to thrive in that position, and the companies that recognize that tend to do far better in the long term, since they are willing to trade short term savings for long term gains while walking the thin line between real research budgets and lazy pot smokers.","['having to create a business case to invest in ML is pretty old school tbh, I feel like maybe we work in different sectors']"

>And this is just empirical research which is pretty rare. Most research is not empirical. Even physics is mostly math and computer simulations nowadays and you don't really do hypothesis type of thing either because it's formal proofs you're after and mostly ""throw shit at the wall until something sticks"".

I agree with most of your post, but this is wrong. Most physics research is experimental and there are very few physicists (even in theory) who care about formal proofs. Heck, the most successful theory in all of physics does not have any formal mathematical background (quantum field theory) and no real physicist actually cares.
I think your background in ML is clouding a little, how much modern research is actually empirical.

But still, strongly agree with the rest. The ""scientific method"" as presented in high school and pop sci is a very simple representation of research that does not actually exist. It ignores that ""formulating a hypothesis"" is often not conductive to actually finding out new stuff and is only really possible for the most simple scientific questions at the end of a long chain of prior research.","[""I've worked with physicists and let me tell you: Particle accelerators and nuclear reactors and such are suuuper expensive and nobody is letting you near a physical experiment before you've done all the math and all the computer simulations and all the literature reviews.\n\nSo in the end your PhD + Post-doc might be 7 non-experiment papers and maybe 1 experiment paper.""]"

It also depends on how they think of their inventory.\n\nSo for example let\'s say we\'re using a CPM model and the advertiser is paying for every impression. This is very common. They have to set the cap on how many times you\'ll see the ad in a certain time, and depending on what they\'re trying to do, they may set their cap high or low. Oftentimes buyers are told ""this is the budget, spend it by Friday"" and an easy way to spend it is to increase the cap.\n\nIf you\'re buying on a CPA basis, that is, Facebook\'s getting paid for actual purchases, not impressions, it makes sense, if they have say 20 ad contracts running, to show you the one that you\'re most likely to buy. So they will manage the cap on impressions to make sure they\'re only showing you stuff that\'s interesting. But at the same time, if you\'re browsing a lot, Facebook wants to show you a lot of ads. Past a certain point you\'ve hit the cap on all the things you\'re likely to buy and it\'s better to keep showing you stuff you\'re tired of. Even if the conversion rate is hundreds of thousands of a percent by that point, if that\'s the best ad they can put in that spot, that\'s what they\'ll do.']"

"This is oversimplified because I don't remember all of the details (almost two decades ago).

Worked for a company that provided Hollywood with projections for how their movies were going to perform. However, different movies would perform differently in different areas. For example, G-rated movies would perform better in small towns, while ""gansta"" movies would perform better in big cities.

Thus, on the projections interface, we would give someone a ""weight"" factor that they would learn to adjust over time, depending on where the movies were shown, and what types of movies they were showing.

The default ""weight"" was 14. Hollywood executives would bump that up or down based on their understanding of it (we worked very hard to keep this dead simple because you can't explain the complexities of this to Hollywood execs).

So we had a developer who worked for six months to overhaul all of our prediction models, because they were OK, but not good enough.

After six months of work, he released his new model, with new weight adjustments for every theater across the US, and the default ""weight"" was changed slightly.

Hollywood execs were furious, accusing us of ""fudging"" the numbers, even though we couldn't figure out how we could ""fudge"" predictions of future sales.

The developer and I went into a meeting with a vice president and the veep explained the political situation. The developer, however, then spent half an hour at a white board explaining the intricacies of the statistical model and why the default weight had to be lowered.

The white board was covered with equations. It was covered with hand-drawn graphs. The developer went on and on and on and after half an hour, the veepwhose eyes had glazed overjust said ""yeah, but change the default weight back.""

Eventually, even though our numbers were more accurate, we had to throw out the entire project because:

1. Hollywood execs adjusting those weights would see different results from before
2. No one could understand the complexity of the new system

It was a painful, expensive exercise in egos versus math.

"It exactly captures the difference between good ol' statistical modeling and machine learning.

The nature of computational thinking is that you invent a way to check the result and then shake the box until the result looks approximately right and there it is. Because implementing box shaking is easy and you can just shake the box really fast, it's a valid approach to solve problems.

How to check the result is the complex part with no ""one right way"" to do it and the reason you get paid 120k. It's also use-case specific due to ""no free lunch"" theorem.

So the whole focus on ML research is more effective and different box shaking mechanisms and what is left for the practitioner is to figure out how to pour things in the box and how to interpret what comes out.

In contrast, the field of statistics is focused on carefully crafted recipes which is pretty much a manual process and doesn't scale well when you need a new recipe every hour to keep up with the newest trends of millenials but works fairly well when whatever you're trying to model is not too complicated and doesn't change regularly.","['This is actually a very good answer.', 'I really like this answer.', '[deleted]']"

I found a research paper that is almost entirely my copied-and-pasted Kaggle work?,"I did some work a couple of years ago on W.H.O. suicide statistics. Here's my [Kaggle project](https://www.kaggle.com/lmorgan95/r-suicide-rates-in-depth-stats-insights) from April 2019, and here's the [research paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338479643_Analysis_of_Mental_Health_Program_based_on_Suicide_Rate_Trends_1985_to_2015) from January 2020.

It was immediately clear from me seeing the graphs that the work was the same, but most of the findings are entire paragraphs lifted from my work. This isn't the first time this has happened but it's probably the most egregious. My work is obviously not mentioned in the references.

Is there anything I can actually do here? I don't care about people using or adapting my public work as long as credit is given, but copying most of it and giving no credit really isn't cool.

Searching on LinkedIn the lead is a university instructor. Makes me wonder if this was student project she advised and was unaware of the plagiarism.   In that case, I suppose I might start by reaching out to the lead author on  LinkedIn or via email and see how far that gets you. Next step would be to reach out to the university (dept head and dean).","['Oh, and congratulations for getting your work published! lol', ""Do this.

You can report their work to ResearchGate to try to get it taken down ([https://www.researchgate.net/ip-policy](https://www.researchgate.net/ip-policy)). You could also try contacting the university or one of the researchers.

B) regardless of them copy+pasting it and giving creditor not, that fraud of a student (Im assuming) out there is likely advancing his degree off your work. Especially if its copy + pasted qualitative findings/analysis, not just the data/results. No different that intellectual theft at that point.

Go prevent that schmuck from bringing the field down.

TL;DR this is an important issue. Go nail the sucker by contacting the university department head.",['100% this']
"This happens to me once- I was a PhD student and one of my paper was copy pasted. I discussed this with my academic advisor and we decided to go with this approach:
1. Email to the lead in the paper and tell him that this is obviously plagiarism and if not retracted, you will notify the university and the journal.
2. Give them 2 weeks to reply or remove the paper.
3. If they didnt, send a mail to the department head and the journal editor- plagiarism is a serious issue.

We decided to go this way just to give the benefit of doubt to the professor in the paper. He or she may not be aware of it. So its better to give him a chance :)

"> So your solution is to make others work for free and donate their money?

I did not say that. Although if people are receiving donations for their work, maybe they are not working for free.

What happens today is that institutions are paying large sums for publishing and acessing those repositories. That money could be better invested in research and improving pay to underpaid scientists.

Journals are not ensuring research quality, even fraud sometimes is accepted. They put paywalls on research funded by public or not for profit money.

> Sci hub isn't a journal they link to journal articles.

Of course it isn't a journal but they host the articles and not just link them so they have probably bigger storage and bandwith associated costs as anyone can use it for free.

> If you don't way to publish in a journal and you think some other method is better your should do that.

Yes but impact factor is a thing and people value status over substance.","[""I really feel like I am talking to a wall because you aren't addressing the things I've already said several times, including...  \n\n\n1) Higher impact means more citations per article. More citations per article happens when articles that are less interesting and impactful aren't published. This is \\*by design.\\* It is not just status, it's a method for figuring out what is worth reading. Peer review is not capable to detecting fraud, they don't go over your data and calculations or anything like that. They always assume good faith. Your institution should be doing a more in depth internal review. It looks very very bad for them if you publish a fraudulent study.  \n\n\n2) This means they read a lot of articles they aren't paid to publish. If you are published, this is means you thus cover THOSE costs as well as YOUR costs. This can greatly impact what you pay. Say 1/10 articles are published. If you are that 1, you pay 10x your personal cost. This is why cheaper journals accept a higher % of papers.  \n\n\n3) Again, people donate to support sci hub. So you are saying you want a donation based model. But they are linking to things, they are not doing independent hosting. Or administrative work, or copy editing, or hosting associated data, or working with articles that don't make the cut.  \n\n\n4) I can't speak for anyone else but I have never worked anywhere where publication costs or journal subscriptions were a large part of our budget that impacted my paycheck. There are a LOT of problems related to why some organizations don't have a good budget and there is a second set of problems related to wealth disparities between countries, neither of which is the fault of, say, Elsevier.  \n\n\nFundamentally, I think a lot of people do not understand where the money goes, what the costs are, or how the industry works.""]"

The support from that was incredible, and I thought Id share an update.

Since then, Ive gone through a dozen interviews, ranging from FANG to startups to MBB, and updated the cheatsheet with topics Ive seen covered in actual interviews.

Improvements include:

* Added Time Series
* Added Statistics
* Added A/B Testing
* Improved Distribution Section
* Added Multi-class SVM
* Added HMM
* Miscellaneous Section
* And a bunch of other small changes scattered throughout!

These topics, along with the material covered previously, are all condensed in a convenient five-page Data Science Cheatsheet, found [here](https://github.com/aaronwangy/Data-Science-Cheatsheet).

Ill be heading to a FANG company as a DS after graduation, and I hope this cheatsheet is helpful to those on the job hunt or just looking to brush up on machine learning concepts. Feel free to leave any suggestions and star/save the repo for reference and future updates!

In the broader analytics space, the same thing happens when you run a split test or a multivariate test on a web page. Some leader, unbeknownst to you, has been making a name for their self in the ""calls to action should all be the color \[x\]"" field of thought leadership.

You run 5 experiments, testing CTA colors. You learn that color doesn't have a single damned effect one way or another on click through rates nor on likelihood to convert during a session. You bring those findings to an org meeting. That leader is there, and she's backed into a corner.

So here it comes. Every time. The assertion: Well, you really can't be certain of these results. How can you guarantee you tested on a representative sample that was large enough?

The word ""guarantee"" is the dagger in the heart of your presentation. You're a statistician. There are never 100% guarantees. You can avoid that word and confidently speak to statistical power and confidence intervals. Or even better Bayes factors.

But then she'll get that other analyst she keeps as a pet to ask if the results are really 100% certain.

Or she'll divert the discussion into the immeasurable realm of faith.

""Well, it's not all about click through rates and conversion rates. Data is great, don't get me wrong. I *love* data. But we need to think about *customer experience*. Improving click rates and conversion rates doesn't consider how important that is. Colors have a lasting impact on how candidates *perceive* our *brand*. We need to make decisions with our data, not let our data make our decisions for us.""

It's all vaguely correct in a marketing-blog sort of way, and many of the leaders in the room will have heard similar bumper-stickerisms elsewhere. So, they'll all get sort of confused and tired and just take the leader's side. They'll thank you so much for managing this experiment and keeping the organization data-driven. And they'll say your results are a ""great start"" and have really given them something to think about.

And then they'll make your dev team change all of the CTAs on the site to that leader's favorite color.","['Are you me?

"So what I can advice is to ensure you put some of your time towards learning, be it YouTube or udemy, coursera etc. its one thing to be at least 50-60% proficient in the big concepts around ML, and then cover the rest of the knowledge by working with colleagues, quiet another to be completely blank and expect that just bombarding DS with questions will get you there.

4. 4 day ""business simulation"" where i started from literal ground zero with a random dataset they gave me and was told to give them industry insights (despite not being familiar with the industry previously and having no knowledge of the company's history etc.)... i would have MUCH rather had a tech interview and been over and done. because they put me on a clock i had a hard time knowing where to begin or who to talk to and didn't get to familiarise myself very well with their data or what all the fields meant etc.
5. 2 hour presentation and debrief (i had nothing to really present on because i didn't have much beyond EDA and general ""here are trends happening in the industry and how they might effect the company""... then got panel grilled and they complained i didn't work on how they could integrate AI tools when they never said anything about AI except ""know how to use it"" and i used chatGPT for a summary???)

"This really is absurd.

Edit:

My ideal interview is the following.

Manager Review 1 Hour
Talk through Behavioral Interview 
Tell me about a time

Compressed Technical:
Here is a hypothetical business problem we have, here is the associated data walk me through your approach 


2. Culture Fit and Deeper Technical  with Team 1 Hour 
Team Behavioral and how you worked with your team 

Take a deeper Dive into Technical

Triage goes:\n\n1) Resume screen (HR) - for basic quals - best resumes are picked\n\n2) Quick talk with the candidates to ask a few questions/clarification/explain the process (HR)\n\n3) Quick talk with manager to see if you're directionally appropriate for the role, because HR knows pretty much jack.\n\nAgain - thats just trying to get down from 1500 resumes to like 20. If we conduct a 2 hour interview for each - thats still like 40 hours of interview time - for 2 managers, a principal data scientist, and possibly another IC. Thats an abusrd amount of time of lost productivity."", ""That's a lot of deep diving"", 'Lmao - what? Its absolutely not.']"

This sub just expects jobs to be handed out like freaking Oprah Winfrey.

FWIW - the interview process that I mostly established for my org (F500 company) is almost identical:

* Recruiter Screen (15-30 min)

* Manager Screen (15-20 min)

* Take home assignment (pretty simple dataset that has some nuance and complexity) - we ask they spend less than 1 hour and provide their code during the main interview.

* main interview 1.5-2 hours: first 15 is talking about role, company, team, etc..., 15 of them talking through resume and about themselves...20-30 talk through the code they provided with our principal DS. ~45 min behavioral based conducted by manager(s) and sometimes a more senior IC. ~30 min open Q&A (both ways).

* final intervew 30 min with myself: This is a really casual meet and greet. At this point my managers have made their decision - if you're at this stage its mostly just so I'm comfortable giving the final sign off. You would have to really mess up to get cut at this point (happened 1 time ever).

I belive this is completely reasonable given that I may be paying someone 100s of thousands of dollars a year.

Edit: only thing that I take issue with here is the references - we validate that people worked where they say they did/went to school where they say...but I would never call for a personal reference.","['>\xa0This sub just expects jobs to be handed out like freaking Oprah Winfrey.\n\nNo, its just that no one wants to have to take multiple vacation days to do interviews along with all the take home assignments.

The coding part is to check you know how to write vaguely clean code and do things in the right order and aren't totally all over the place.\n\nWe've literally had people apply for senior data science positions who couldn't open a csv with pandas. \n\nThen you get excited people who did modelling in their own time.\n\nI know people say the market is saturated, but in my experience for every 20 candidates we interview, we hire 1. 5 of them won't even look at the data, 5 of them will struggle with basic coding stuff like opening files, dropping columns, error debugging, 5 of them will struggle to explain what precision and recall are and why you pick one over the other. And out of the last 5, 2 of them will have already gotten an offer, 1 of them uses us to negotiate their current position, 1 turns down an offer, 1 accepts.""]"
