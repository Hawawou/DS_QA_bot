data siens,I was once reading this article that went as: “The AI already predicted how many goals Cavani will score at Manchester United”. It was a linear regression.
The pain and excitement,Upper management doesn't care.
Shout Out to All the Mediocre Data Scientists Out There,Preach. It's okay for your job to just be a job.

It’s never too early,"Look if your baby came out of the womb not knowing Python, R, real analysis, and a MITx micromasters certificate I question your parenting skills. If they don't have a double PhD in CS and statistics by age 5, I'm calling CPS."
how about that data integrity yo,"If you find a good data engineer, you do everything in your power as a data scientist to keep them working with you. Lol"
Didn’t have to chart this one 🔥,Fascinating to see a drop in usage at 95 before lots of usage at 100 - assuming this is a psychological thing where if you’re in the 90+ range you want to hit the 100 milestone instead of settling for 95
Wait until you see the data in hospitals...,"Currently working in the NHS.

I think a better version of this would start with the house, THEN show the house deconstructed into raw data, and finally display a low fidelity scale model of a house at the end."
Favourite piece of code 🤣,"Bloody data scientists lol. Just use the function it tells you to use in the warning, instead of the 10 year out of date depreciated pandas function you stole from someone's kaggle workbook."
"I created a four-page Data Science Cheatsheet to assist with exam reviews, interview prep, and anything in-between","Nice work! Maybe consider adding another page with most used libraries, which are bound to appear in exams and interviews. That way the prospective data scientist can go and look for them to investigate further. Also if you think you are missing something important, I like [this website](https://blog.datasciencedojo.com/machine-learning-algorithms/) a lot."
I want to be free of this pain.,"Management: Now. MOAR PIE CHARTS, peon! And also those little pie charts with the holes in the middle that I like so much. They pleeeeeease me."
True that,"Perfect example of why the result is what matters and how technical jobs/people can get lost in their skill. 

No one wants to pay (salaries) for analysis. They pay for insights that lead to actions that lead to more money. If there is any stop before the “more money” part it’s not interesting. Research is fantastic but only if you apply it in the right way. A PhD who focuses his time on guiding high value decisions will not be making 30k a year."
"As a hiring manager - this, this right here",He also has a PhD in mathematics so I'm sure that helped
Imposter Detected,"This is me. I am a ""Data Scientist"" that has only built a handful of linear/logistic regression models that have never gotten used. I mostly use SQL, Tableau, and Python for data cleaning.

Not that I am complaining, but if I ever talk to another business or individual that does do true Data Science work, it feels like this."

Other than that, it's not terrible data. My last job search was similarly painful. MY advice would be to focus on the positive - try to see people that reject you or ghost you as 'their loss' which is ultimately how you should look at things."

When a non-technical manager wants details behind your model.,"I realize this is just a meme, so this isn't a criticism,  but there's a valid approach to dealing with this.  

When you teach a semester long class to students, you teach from the bottom up, ensuring they understand the fundamentals so they can build upon them going forward. 

However, when you give a talk to an audience of non-specialists, in a time-limited setting, you do exactly the opposite: you do top-down, explaining the big picture and only going into details as time and interest dictate.  They'll stop asking questions when they lose interest, but it's your job to anticipate and steer questions until they reach that point, breaking the subject down into progressively more granular pieces until they're satisfied.  

Almost all highly technical subjects can be explained this way.  You're Stephen hawking and you're narrating the audiobook of A Brief History of Time.  I consider it a personal failing on my behalf if I can't explain my work to a general audience in a way that doesn't leave them confused."

Fit an exponential curve to anything...,This is funny because this is how all forecasts work for bullshit bubble technologies.
The next time my coworkers ask what metrics I used for my model.,All the other metrics have failed. Total losers.
My Data Science Manifesto from a Self Taught Data Scientist,"As a stats professor who teaches DS, your point about evaluation is especially important with the rise in generative models. It was already a challenge getting DS students to think critically about the *practical* performance of their models before LLMs, and now model evaluation more important than ever.

While I agree that you don’t need to memorize all the statistical models and tests as long as you’re aware of where to find them and how to use them, I’ll add that it’s equally important to know *when* to reach for them. Too many students struggle with recognizing when a problem calls for statistical testing rather than classification. When all you know is ML, everything looks like a prediction problem.

And communication!!! If you can’t explain the relevance of your results to laypeople, you’re not going to be an effective data scientist."
:),"Machine learning is so 2017. Try ""AI-powered machine intelligence"".

Edit: the people have spoken, ""AI-powered deep machine intelligence"" is the correct term here."

Amazon is a great first role, you'll learn a lot. I don't know if they still have the program for interns, but try to ask your manager to help you find a mentor. It makes a world of difference. Good luck :)"

Let me tell you, C-Suite usually only ask for Salaries by job profiles. That's it. No engagement scores, performance metrics, Management reviews. Nada. They rarely dig into the specifics of who you are as a person, rather the role you play in the company and what roles are ""expendable"".

It blows my mind how unscientific and how broad the brushstrokes are when they layoff people. It's literally the most awkward and clunky way to save money. It's as if Finance went through a car and started tearing up things they don't need with 0 knowledge of how a car actually works. For the most part they will 100% save money, but in the long term, that car will fall apart and the remaining pieces are overworked and fail sooner. Taking off hubcaps, spare tires, air caps...."

Results of my first data science job search. Some insight in the comments.,"I am an ABD PhD student who decided to transition into a data science-related position in industry. My field of study is heavy in statistics and optimization and I have 3 years of research experience in machine learning. I started applying for jobs on 4/21, primarily targeting Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer positions at non-MANGA companies. I accepted an offer yesterday. Here are some observations I had throughout the process that may be helpful for other job seekers:

\- I never got a single response from MANGA, even with referrals for several positions

\- I got several phone screens for positions which wanted 3+ years of industry experience, despite having 0. The recruiters for these positions seemed like they were having a hard time finding candidates, use this to your advantage.

\- Just mentioning that I had existing offers/other interviews scheduled to the recruiter would usually let me bypass stages of the interview process. Both of the offers I got resulted from this tactic. Don't be afraid to namedrop fancy companies, if you can.

\- The offer that I declined had a substantial on-call component to the job, but the job posting/recruiter NEVER mentioned this. If I hadn't specifically asked during a team fit call after the offer was made, they would have never told me. Be sure to ask lots of probing questions when you talk to the hiring manager/team you would join.

\- My communication was cited as one of the decisive factors leading to my offers. While technical skills are important, I got the impression that communication was highly valued at most of the companies I talked to. Don't neglect that skillset.

Edit: I wanted to clarify that I am NOT finishing my PhD. I am leaving the program after 3 years with only a masters degree."

But yes, there is a huge difference between somebody who has perfect aim with a hammer and a true craftsman."

EDIT: as others mentioned below, looks like it's a pre-print.  All authors use a gmail address, except the lead. The upload occured from one of the authors with a gmail address.  Searching on LinkedIn the lead is a university instructor. Makes me wonder if this was student project she advised and was unaware of the plagiarism.   In that case, I suppose I might start by reaching out to the lead author on  LinkedIn or via email and see how far that gets you. Next step would be to reach out to the university (dept head and dean)."

"Hi! I just expanded the Data Science Cheatsheet to five pages, added material on Time Series, Statistics, and A/B Testing, and landed my first full-time job","This is an excellent resource for reviewing ML concepts, but I don't think calling it a DS cheatsheet is helping. There's already enough people thinking DS = ML.

A true DS cheatsheat would have sections on how to solve actual business problems, common KPIs, how to build and evaluate data/ML pipelines, etc. I know you said the purpose was to tackle things that are common to all DS positions, but IMO the things that are common (ML algorithms) generally make up a very small portion of any one job. Even in the interview process I find case studies + coding + SQL + behavioral questions to be the majority of the questions."

Data Science interviews these days,"I just had an interview that went like this:

1. Recruiter screen
2. Live SQL (30mins)
3. Live Python (45mins)
4. Hiring Manager (behavioral) (30mins)
5. Live Data Exploration (1 hour)
6. Live Modelling (1 hour)
7. Stats case study (30min)
8. Product Manager behavioral (30mins)
9. Other PM behavioral (30mins)
10. Hiring Manager catchup (30mins)

5-10 were on the same day as part of the “super day”.

The live data exploration was the fucking dumbest thing I’ve ever done. Giving me a dataset that I’m not a domain expert on, not related to the role, and asking me question without letting me actually explore the data first. Should have been a fuxking take home.

The live modeling is also stupid, but I was well prepared for it so that went well. But I’m still so bitter about that data exploration interview."
