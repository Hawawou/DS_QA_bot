Lol RA Fisher and his arbitrary number.,"It was Neyman and Pearson who popularized binary hypothesis testing. Fisher was always mindful that 0.05 was a convenient, but arbitrary cutoff. Fisher had this to say:

> [‚Ä¶] no scientific worker has a fixed level of significance at which from year to year, and in all circumstances, he rejects hypotheses; he rather gives his mind to each particular case in the light of his evidence and his ideas."
"I know this a meme, but remember that 0.05 is arbitrary, you can still go forward with one that is larger, there is no law that says 0.05 is the only valid one.",king of statistics here to say that this is untrue. if you set alpha > 0.05 regardless of context you will be thrown in jail.

"I'm glad there's finally some stats talk in this sub. It's usually comp sci and programming dominated.

But uh, give me a big enough sample size and I'll make you a model that shows everything is significant.  Since data science is usually big data sets, pretty much everything ever is going to be p<0.000000000000.

Word of caution to folks who are new-ish to industry:  Don't be the guy who presents 'highly significant' findings of p<0.05 on a data set of 1 million observations, or even a couple hundred thousand observations.

Can anyone explain for someone who is only a couple months into programming? üòÅ,"This is a statistical concept, not a programming concept. To describe it really roughly, when we analyze results of something we ask ourselves, ""Can we conclude that something important is happening here? Or are these results just a matter of chance?"" A P value is what we use to determine what the chances are that the results would occur - the lower the p value, the lower the chances. This means that there is some kind of important observable correlation happening, because the results are not just a matter of chance. Statisticians can determine what p value they will deem ""statistically significant."" A very common one is .05. If an experiment yields something less then .05 p value, they will label that statistically significant, but more than that they will say it can't be concluded that something is happening here. This is somewhat arbitrary and it is a human categorization. It doesn't have to be .05. It could be less, it could be more depending on the context. This meme is making the joke that we would consider .051 not statistically significant, but .049 would be, highlighting that this is an arbitrary distinction. Hopefully I've explained that correctly, please let me know if I misexplained anything.

If you want to learn more about this concept, which you definitely should if you're going into any data-based job, you'll want to google ""p-value"" and ""statistical significance""."
A lot of conversation about .05 being an arbitrary number but if you set your CI at 95% at least you can say that your population estimate does not include 0. Or am I incorrect?,You really can‚Äôt say that even at 95%

It's the other way around. Data scientists kneeling down waiting for data engineers to give them clean data because you're screwed otherwise.,I think most Data Scientists learned to clean data by themselves rather than waiting to be saved by a Data Engineer.
The meme should be reversed imo. I have an over abundence of data scientist and not enough engineers,"Yeah, this graphic is pretty presumptuous. Hmmm, I wonder if it‚Äôs creator is a DS or a DE‚Ä¶"
I mean as a data scientist in the clinical world most of what I do is data cleaning/normalization mapping etc. probably 5% of my time is spent on model development....,Me too exactly
"If you're relying on the engineer to tee up a perfect data set for you, im a little curious what you actually *do* as a data scientist. Sounds like the DE is about one random forest away from taking your job as well.","Exactly, a data scientist doesn't wait for a data engineer to start working. A data engineer doesn't care about what the data scientist needs on his on his/her plate. If someone is working in a company where 'data scientist' can only work if 'data engineer', provides him/her data.

Then:

1. You company doesn't have a real data scientist. 

2. Your company thinks the data scientists job is to produce something magical from the data.

3. Your company doesn't know what data engineering is."

"I honestly think that data science is going to end up like any other branch of science in the next few decades. A common base of understanding and knowledge to draw from, and a number of fields to explore and specialise in, so that members of one field have to actively try to understand what members of another field are doing.

And I finished up my graduate work in a split curriculum of vocational evaluation and research design.

The reason that was important was that my clients were aiming at just about every kind of career imaginable from artist to doctor to exotic dancer to grocery checkout person, so I had to know about all the fields, or at least be able to familiarize myself.

Reductionism has never been my friend.

That's why I say that statistics isn't mathematics - it's problem solving and problem solving is generic. You're handed a problem and you whale away at it until it takes some recognizable shape that you understand. Archival research has a regal place there. But problem solving is generic because you don't have to begin with an understanding of a problem. What you have to have is an understanding of how to solve problems...observation, evaluation, analysis, synthesis, hill climbing...how to find information, and most importantly, a confidence that you can crack any problem and determination, and a love of adventure.",is a statistics degree (undergrad) a smart idea to pursue? is it marketable and could i work in the field of science if i do it alongside a degree in chemistry?

**Quote**

>There is a striking phonetic similarity between big data technology and pokemon names. Can you create a service that generates strings that sound like potential pokemon names? And what might be the simplest possible way to make that into a service? Also, would it be possible to generate pokemon names that start with three random characters and end with 'base' (KREBASE, MONBASE would be appropriate but IEYBASE would not be).

>Turns out that this is an interesting problem from a ML standpoint and that it is rediculously easy to build in the cloud. In my talk I will explain the ML behind it;

>markov chains
>probibalistic graphs
>rnn/lstm
>bidirectional lstm

Tell the team to email their requests so you can provide more ""insights"" from the data *going beyond the dashboard*, then ignore their emails until they sent their 4th email or someone other than them tells you to give something. Then just put some numbers on a excel sheet and send it to them.

This is a joke and if any recruiter see this, I want to you to know, I am a team player who likes seeing the story behind the numbers and assisting the non-engineering team in achieving greatness and glory.

I essentially stopped the whole building useless dashboards so that we can actually focus on the revenue generation stuff. Just required a decent amount of pushback. We are all happy now and I'm just waiting until the true value generating work comes in.,What kind of revenue generation stuff did you focus on? My organization is all about dashboarding useless info to say that we have dashboards available anytime. Would be nice to hear how you broke that.

This being a joke but I experience this mentality all the time. We had to deal with a couple of very entitled PhDs that thought everybody was an idiot but could not deliver any business value to our department. Ended up using Automodel software that got us the result.,That's how literally I got involved with DS. We had this genius PhD (he actually had 2 post-docs in stats) that knew 'everything there is to know' about statistics. He couldn't deliver anything with real business value because he understood 0 about the business side of the problem we were trying to solve
"I know this is a joke but the truth is, as you move up this ladder, the roles change from purely theoretical (having no consequences) to implementing changes affecting a billion dollars a year. You also move from working 40-50 hours to 70 hours a week and add 20 years of industry based experience around how to make those decisions to your graduate degree.

Edit: changed 90+ hours a week to 70 hours.","That 90+ hours a week work week for CEOs is super duper false. Studies have been done that show an average of 60 hours a week spent working. Which, btw, is more in the realm of what the work week for a humble telecom technician does. Just because Elon Musk likes to say he works that much doesn't mean most CEOs actually do. For the record, when people like Musk report ridiculous work hours, it's usually a good idea to be skeptical anyway. He's pretty well known for outlandish claims.

I'm seeing what I can do over next 6-12 months to improve my resume when things get better","A well-done personal project can be huge. It makes it easier to evaluate the quality of your work, your ability to communicate, your ability to ask an interesting question, etc. 

But the caveat is that I think its tough to a good personal project. If someone sends their github that has a bunch of low-value projects, I get nothing out of that. I've seen a lot of candidates that have like 4-5 prediction projects that take standard datasets (iris, titanic, some move review things, etc) and then do a standard ""here's how I cleaned the data, here's where I trained the model, this is the AUC, and here's some feature importances"". If there's nothing interesting about the datasets or the approach, then I'm just going to ignore them. It certainly wont count against the candidate but it feels like they wasted their time putting up these very vanilla analyses. 

The best personal projects have been ones where people were really interested in the topic, likely had to construct their own dataset to get something to answer, and then wrote it up to highlight the results and only the most interesting technique needed to get that result."

"I recently published a paper in a reasonably high impact journal in my field (cancer genomics).

I initiated the study and performed all of the data collection, tidying, analysis, statistics, and visualization. This included a fair amount of bioinformatics, including sequence alignment and variant calling, RNA expression analysis, DNA methylation analysis, and survival analyses.

I did this *exactly* as stated above; my background is in cancer biology (I have a PhD in it), so I had subject area expertise, but I had no formal DS background.

But I picked a problem and went to work on it. Did sooooo much Googling, and eventually developed those skills.

Today, I can do all of those things - and so much more - because not only did I learn the skills, I learned how to learn new skills. That, to me, is the critical bit; no one will know everything, but understanding how to ingest new knowledge is so critical.",Congrats on the pub!

"Focusing on tools and programming languages is a bit amateur hour in my honest opinion. Businesses hire data people to help them understand the past, understand the present, and maybe try to predict the future kinda all around their business needs & goals.

If SQL and Tableau are what's needed at your organization to drive decision making using data, then lean into those tools! Other places may use Python or, god forbid, C. 

What matters more is -- are you working on high impact problems that affect the business?

This can be generalized to nonprofits as well. Is your work helping to drive outcomes that the leadership team cares about? If not, you should be concerned even if you're doing awesome neural networks programming but aren't able to explain your connection to the business, product, etc.

"Calling this a 'graph' in data science is problematic imo but I think generally accepted, 'graph analysis' however is incredibly misused here.

A graph in this case is actually the graph 'of a function' (or graph 'of a relationship') or a plot (the actual graphic part).

"If such a high percentage of applications are getting no response, I'd suggest it's an issue with getting past ATS. Keywords and keyphrases from the job description must appear in the resume in order to meet the ATS parameters.

If candidates can make it past the ATS nightmare, then they have to deal with HR/""talent acquisition"" screeners who often don't know much (if anything) about the roles they source. The next hoop to jump through is dealing with hiring managers who expect a perfect unicorn candidate to plop down in their lap. It's a broken process with many layers of problems.

All that said, if you have 5 years of analytics experience, it's probably best to avoid anything that specifically states that it's ""entry level,"" but also keep in mind that in many cases the people posting the jobs don't always properly categorize them, so the default categories remain unchanged.",I hate how applying for a job has become a part/full-time job in itself.

Go on LinkedIn to see if anyone from your past universities can give you a referral when you apply.

Try to target a few specific industries and tailor your resumes for them. Work on projects for your portfolio that are relevant to hiring managers in those industries. This also helps to get past ATS.

Get your resume looked at by a professional.

Go to your university's career center to see if they can connect you with any companies who are hiring analytics professionals.

Last point, if you weren't able to convert 1 of those 14+ interviews into a job offer, that's definitely something to look into. You can hire a DS professional to do a mock interview with you.

Most companies are still building out their data practice and need experienced folks for that. Those folks are still trying to prove value and don‚Äôt have the capacity to mentor junior folks. Most entry level DS roles are at big tech companies with huge mature data teams, and they get significantly more applications than they have open positions.

a. Leverage personal networks/recruiters over cold applies. I‚Äôve almost exclusively been placed rather than hired from a cold apply in my career. Success rate is extremely high for me when working with a recruiter who has a vested interest in placing me.
b. Don‚Äôt be afraid of a good internship. Pay might not be the glamorous promised starting wage at $100k but you can quickly grow a portfolio and get promoted to a full data science role. My experience tells me it‚Äôs much easier to find a job while employed than unemployed.
c. You might not have a lot of experience, but what you need is a portfolio. When I look at young analyst/data science hires I look for passion for the field.

At least I didn‚Äôt get a masters in sociology or arts or something","I got a masters degree in Sociology and work as a data scientist, but never had much trouble landing a job. The market for data scientists may have become more saturated over the past few years and Sociology certainly isn't a great background, but I landed a junior role as a data analyst anyway and had even less problems progressing in my career from there. There's a lot of tried and true advice that helps more than just applying a whole bunch of times and hoping for the best, I think. 

- select the job openings that fit best with your skills and achievements. You may not tick every box and the job may not offer everything you look for, but try to find the best match.
- tailor your application to the role.
- try to get in direct contact with the organisation to get a foot in the door. Ask details that are not in the job posting but helpful to know. Basically, make a good impression regardless of an interview taking place. But there's a fine line between showing interest and being too pushy, so tread carefully. 

Basically, sniping the best opportunities always worked well for me. Hiring managers have a good intuition for cookie cutter applications and will be triggered by an application that stands out from the rest. This assumes your application is read in the first place and you're not one in hundred applicants for a position. For me, that has always been the case because I look for the openings where I stand a good chance, anyway."
when can people realize data science (non phd level) is a scam,"Would you recommend a different masters degree?

Data Science in 2022,Some companies are asking Data Science skills but want to pay for a Data analyst
Some companies are asking Data Science skills but want to pay for a Data analyst,Or you have companies like mine which pay for DS but only need DAs lol
"I can relate.

My company wanted machine learning models, but in the process of building them, they discovered that the exploratory data analysis gives them enough insights to work on business strategies. 

So models were relegated to a second priority over understanding the business processes and customers in detail.

I‚Äôm fine with that. They pay me good money for a few hours of work per day.","Exactly this.  I see people getting upset about the role changing from machine learning to data visualizations and EDA but they don't realize that making six figures is hard in many other fields.

I'd take the EDA work any day."
"I'm here dealing with that but it's ""Tier-3 Tech support"" and ""Data Science"".",I'm curious to hear more about your experience. I feel I may be in a similar place.
"I think many are confused about the definition of analytics, the difference between analysis and analytics, and the role responsibilities of an analyst vs data scientist.  An analyst does analytics work, but so does a data scientist. Some people say ‚Äúadvanced analytics‚Äù to distinguish machine learning/data mining within analytics.",Thank you. Analytics is an umbrella term. I think a lot of people don't understand that
It's fascinating to me how the debate between what constitutes data analyst vs. data scientist has basically become a representation of a classification problem with a squishy decision boundary.,"Honestly, I‚Äôd be more surprised if it hadn‚Äôt. Lion tamers get mauled by lions, Data tamers get mauled by ambiguity."
"It‚Äôs kind of a shame the community had to create a new unnecessary term just to give a ‚Äúcool factor‚Äù. Analytics has always included statistics and modeling and you really can‚Äôt separate analytics and modeling. Correctly understood, analytics is a far better representation of the work a Data Scientist does.","I am thrown out of the loop by this thread. I always assumed that the actual line between DA and DS position is amount of time and sophistication you put into modelling. DAs tend to take off the shelf models and refine them for the business task, while DS can spend time figuring out new approaches and models.

Am I wrong?"
So when is this bubble going to burst ? When are companies going to start titling and compensating their employees properly based on the skill set they bring to the table.,"Because it‚Äôs not just skill set, it‚Äôs the value they bring to the company and a data analyst can bring a lot of value"
"Imo, if you write code you're a data scientist. If you build dashboards or use no-code solutions, you're a data analyst.","What if you write code to build dashboards

"Data analyst should be a software based role. A csv tool, a visualization tool, an etl tool, a sql database tool. If you do anything beyond that you should be getting a data science wage imo.",Yet half the users here would gladly settle for a US-style data analytics salary.
"Yeah this isn‚Äôt quite right.

It‚Äôs kind of like a registered nurse to a physician; a physician could, theoretically do a nurses job, but would largely be better utilized as a physician. If a physician is only performing in the scope of an nurses role, that company could save a lot of money by just hiring a registered nurse.

The other way around also applies, an analyst may understand some tasks of a data scientist, but the scope and expectation of knowledge in data science is much greater.

It‚Äôs not as clear cut as it is in medicine because of licensing, but the dynamic is remarkably similar, they are both practicing medicine with the same goal, but they are not at all performing the same role.",What is it that a data scientist does that the data analyst cant do?
"It's the titles that rub me the wrong way, seeing people I know well and their skill set somehow get titles like ""Data scientist III"" or ""Manager of data science"" when we both know damn good and well they can't even spell python.",What rubs me the wrong way is how half the people on this sub think that DS is only ML smh

Stop asking data scientist riddles in interviews!,Never seen anything interesting from this woman who gets pushed in my Linkedin feed all the time.
"I‚Äôm not technically a data scientist. I work as a quant in finance and my work overlaps quite a bit. Every interview I‚Äôve been in with coworkers (or job I‚Äôve interviewed for), focused on brain teasers and case studies way too often.

I‚Äôm not convinced that the purpose of these questions are anything but dick measuring contests. It‚Äôs a waste of time and will tell you almost nothing about the person compared to in depth questions about past experience and projects.",">I‚Äôve never seen a candidate not struggle, take forever and feel demoralized afterwards.

Well you made me feel a bit better, at least."
"Typically we use portfolio/experience to evaluate technical skills. What we're looking for in an interview is soft skills and ability to navigate corporate culture. 

Data scientists have to be able to be technically competent while being socially conscious and not being assholes to non-data scientists.",I've had candidates with good looking resumes be unable to tell me the definition of a p-value and 'portfolios' don't really exist for people in my industry.  Some technical evaluation is absolutely necessary.

"i just got done with a whole bunch of ds interviews (twitter, google, fb, shipt) and didn't get a single brain teaser type probability/combinatorics type question.",What were some of the actual questions you got asked?
"Data scientists should be *experts* in probability and probability theory.

That's what data science is *based on*.

Don't make them calculate some BS numbers by hand or whatever, but absolutely test their understanding of probability. There are A LOT of DS's that make A LOT of mistakes and poor models because they didn't have a good understanding of probability, but rather were good enough programmers that read about some cool ML models.

Understanding probability is *fundamental* to the position.","This is true. However, under pressure, the slow thinking brain, _necessary_ for DS, isn‚Äôt on. If you want to test their ability to recall probability under pressure, youre shooting yourself in the foot. 

The fast thinking a DS should do is comfortable communication with stakeholders + management."
"What source of probability questions are good to check out from time to time? I‚Äôve been in my job for 2.5 years, I‚Äôd prolly bomb an interview at this point",I‚Äôd love to know this as well
The point of the riddles isn't (\*shouldn't be\*) to see if you can get the right answer. It's to see how you reason through a problem you've never seen before.,Those brain teaser questions are seen before like textbook exercise or something like that. There is a pattern.

"Which weighs more, a pound of feathers or a pound of bricks?",Depends how many feathers and bricks you can buy for 1¬£.
"THIS. Happened to me during a final stage interview process. I just kept wondering when I would use this in the field. We‚Äôre not riddle masters, we just know what to do with data and how to leverage it for better decision making. That‚Äôs it.","Wondering where you can use problem solving is a problem-solving field is the exact wrong thing to do in an interview. What you should've done is take a deep breath, evaluate, honestly, your current knowledge, let your interviewer know what you think what your approach is, try to solve it that way, talk your way through your thinking process, if you feel you're getting stuck, be upfront about it and ask for clues. Best of all, show your cards: this I know, this I don't, this is how my thought process goes. And meantime showing how you would interact with your boss/co-worker on solving it. And best of all, if you can show a single spark of having fun \*while\* dealing with a difficult problem in a supposedly high-stress situation, you're golden.

Don't try to cheat and pretend to solve riddle if you already know the answer. Believe me, we can tell. Telling upfront ""I know this one"", you may still get  a request to present your solution, but be judged on clear and short explanation.

Oh yea, be prepared for your solution to be challenged with blatantly wrong and confused ""correct answer"" by your future boss. Entertain one ""what an idiot"" thought(or let it be known if you are one) and you're shown the door. Have conviction if you know you're right, argue in a civil manner, best of all turn this process into the search for truth, remember to have fun, be respectful, but honest.

See, there's no magic here. Observe the interviewer. Will it be any fun to debug a hard one with him/her after hours on Friday because the board needs answer Monday morning and the current result makes no sense, or will you hate every second of it?"

"Responses in this thread are fascinating.

I think the disparity is in confidence of explanation. I can detail and justify every step of data cleaning, the less explanatory the model though, the less confidence I have in it.

If my explanation is limited to terms of scores and performance, I badly struggle with justification.","This is the heart of the struggle in data science.  Given enough time and compute resource, you can build an amazing model, that will absolutely not be accepted by the end user because it can't be explained.

The key to success is to find the model form that is simultaneously good enough to show predictive power, and explainable to the (non-DS) end user.  This is not a trivial challenge."

This will return a URL which you can view in your browser. Once you close your session or after an hour of inactivity (whichever comes first) D-Tale will clean itself up."
Could this be launched in RStudio using reticulate?,"This is only for python unfortunately but if you had the time to install python you could try exporting your R data to CSV or JSON and use the command line options to load it into D-Tale: [CLI options](https://github.com/man-group/dtale#command-line)

"Amazing! I just wonder if the UI and the browser functionality will work in a remote jupyter server (like aws Sagemaker) because I read it'll use the system default browser, or am I misunderstanding that part? 
Keep the good work!","So I've done some work using this in jupyterhub and it does get tricky if you're running it within docker.  You'll have to add `--network host` when runing the container so the ports will be opened to the outside world.

I've also had trouble if you're running jupyterhub over a proxy.  You'll have to add someway to allow for certain ports to be open for D-Tale processes.  I did a big re-write a while back so that there is a little bit of predictability to how the ports are chosen for D-Tale.  Now it starts at 40000 and then keep incrementing until it finds an open one.  So you could update your proxy to allow for port 4000 to be open for D-Tale processes and then just keep killing the previous D-Tale instance if you open a new notebook and create a new instance.  If you just keep calling `dtale.show` within one notebook it will be fine becuase it only opens one instance and adds more data globally available to it.

The urls to your D-Tale instances should be sharable.  To access what the URL is you can do one of two things:

1) if you've stored your D-Tale instance in a variable you can do something like this:

```
d = [dtale.show](https://dtale.show)(df)
print(d._url) . # sent this link to others to view it
```
2) in the ipython cell that D-Tale is running there should be an option in the menu for ""Open Popup"".  This will open D-Tale in a new window which should have the url listed in the top and you can send that to others.

Hope this helps!"

You don't want to allow a specific port through (although if you go that route 40000 is the best choice) because if you run multiple notebooks each with a different D-Tale instance they will be on different ports.

I think the data cleaning is at least half of the center box by itself.,Half is an understatement. More like 75%
What‚Äôs missing from this are the arrows pointing backwards for when things don‚Äôt work quite right.,Looping
If you think about it tho they aren‚Äôt wrong. It‚Äôs a level out but it summarizes what‚Äôs happening. It‚Äôs our job to make it happen and explain it like the above flow.,"Yeah exactly.

[deleted],"Artificial intelligence simply means intelligent decisions that are rendered by anything other than a human.

"I'm in senior management, relying on data scientists. I've put the effort in to understand the basics of data science well enough for my role, I think.

When new people come in, it takes quite some time before we can get past the senior-managers-are-idiots perception. This post going for a false dichotomy to try to feed the prejudice is a good example of the culture.

I don't think the beautiful field of data science benefits from feeding the narrative of them-and-us, and most people don't like to work with people whose default mode is to look down upon them. 

And yes, I get that many management teams are a pain, technology is misunderstood and overrated. There's push for solutions, where the problem isn't understood well. And yes, people can know just enough to screw things up. 

But hey, can't we just all get along?","I'm middle management, so I sit right between the folks going ""Execs don't get it"" and ""Engineers are being pricks"".

I agree that the tone of this post is a little dismissive. Try not to take it as a personal attack though. There are definitely high level managers who couldn't differentiate a clustering algorithm from a hole in the ground. There are also smart ones, who *could* understand and articulate the nuances of different statistical methods if they needed to.

I'm actually saving the image OP posted to show our CTO. Not to rib him and tease him about ""not getting it"" (he's smart and has a math background; totally could if he needed to). But to help give a ""whole iceberg"" view of the process and help him set the right expectations as we embark on a handful of ""AI"" projects.

**tldr:** Some managers suck. Good managers can still benefit from visual aids."

When a non-technical manager wants details behind your model.,"I realize this is just a meme, so this isn't a criticism,  but there's a valid approach to dealing with this.  

When you teach a semester long class to students, you teach from the bottom up, ensuring they understand the fundamentals so they can build upon them going forward. 

However, when you give a talk to an audience of non-specialists, in a time-limited setting, you do exactly the opposite: you do top-down, explaining the big picture and only going into details as time and interest dictate.  They'll stop asking questions when they lose interest, but it's your job to anticipate and steer questions until they reach that point, breaking the subject down into progressively more granular pieces until they're satisfied.  

Almost all highly technical subjects can be explained this way.  You're Stephen hawking and you're narrating the audiobook of A Brief History of Time.  I consider it a personal failing on my behalf if I can't explain my work to a general audience in a way that doesn't leave them confused."

Here is a non technical manager. Just wanted to thank you for all the times even if I will not understand it you (DS of the world) still make the effort to explain üòä,What a kind comment! Definitely just take this as a funny meme and not what most DS people believe.
"Ehh if you can't explain it to non technical people what's the point?

If we hide behind the I'm smarter than thou the information we find is useless as no one else values it.

Embrace the adult education, let data lead the way don't ostrichise people for knowing less teach them.","I hope nobody takes this meme too seriously, and I don't imagine most DS really believe this. It's just supposed to be silly."
"I know we like to snark about this, but being able to explain your model to someone w/out a technical background is a useful skill, especially if they're the ones signing your checks.

They don't care about Jacobians or backprop, but if they feel like they're *involved*, that can be really beneficial for you (especially if you'll have a big ask in the future).","The other side of it is that if you simply enough for a non-technical boss to understand it, they are liable to start thinking that what you do is easy or that they are actually personally responsible for the core valuable ideas. Not that you shouldn't try to explain it well anyway."

"I have a contract writing data science content for a business leaders course. It's... genuinely difficult to dumb down some of the stuff they are asking me to write about. Like explaining the difference between certain more complex algorithms without talking about math. It's one thing explaining the reasoning behind a specific business analysis you did, another to try to explain out of content what exactly an algorithm does for people who are likely at a pre-algebra math level at best. Depends on the algorithm, of course, but some are easier than others.

It's doable, it just takes time to really think it through and extract the essence. And lots of visuals. Teaching truly is an art.

People love buzzwords until they need to find out what they actually mean.",Lots of these thing are complicated and there is only so much that explained simply without using explanations which are plain wrong. How much we justify 'lying to children' I'm never sure.
Before people start taking this too seriously: it's just a meme. I've never met a DS who has not been willing to explain concepts to someone who is curious.,"I never pass up a chance to show how smart I am. If I explain how k-means works, they think I invented it and wrote all the algorithms to make it work."
"The key is that understanding how a model works doesn‚Äôt help understand the model, no matter how much the person asking believes that to be the case.

I once had an otherwise good customer who wanted me to explain how a Random Forest worked, so they could better understand the results. When I saw that my pushback was hurting the relationship, I wrote up a very good explanation, complete with worked illustration, of building a decision tree. Maybe 3 pages long. The topic never came up again, but I had preserved the relationship with a sincere attempt (as hard as it was for me to spend the time, knowing it would not actually be helpful).","I disagree... I think understanding how a tool works can greatly increase effectiveness and prevent misuse.  Unless you've built a 100% fool-proof tool, but those are hard to come by.  But I also agree since on a practical level the workings of the tool may be too advanced for many users to fully grasp without the proper background.  So i agreedisagree. :)"
"I‚Äôm a PM and often ask myself if I‚Äôm technical. OP, what do you consider technical?","Any feedback on presented results that isn‚Äôt to do with title name/font, visual size or data colours"
"I really want to see someone explain stochastic gradient descent to a non technical person. It could be its own Netflix series. The pain, the tears, the frustration... Ultimately ends in murder and or suicide.","There's this snowy hill, and you're trying to find the fastest way down with your sled. So you try different routes."

Laughs in Julia,What about Julia? (Genuine question)
By ‚Äúvectorized‚Äù we mean ‚Äúbroadcasted‚Äù right?,"No. Vectorized means on a per-element basis, but vectorized operations will obviously require broadcasting if the array sizes don‚Äôt match. 

If you‚Äôre familiar with linear algebra, normally a matrix dot product operation with, say, a 3x3 matrix A and a 3x1 vector b will collapse one of the dimensions, and you‚Äôll get a 3x1 vector as an output. In Numpy, writing A * b will result in each column of A being multiplied element-wise by the vector b, which obviously requires broadcasting."

Except that the mathematics of viral growth *is* exponential...,"The models for infections due to viral spread are exponential assuming ""natural"" progression.  

With a strong understanding of the dynamics of viral transmission/spread in a population and carefully chosen interventions, you can manipulate the behavior to do just about whatever you want. The resulting data could look like almost anything. 

You could have a discrete step function better model what's going on if you fully isolate cases and have the ability to intentionally cure/infect people strategically at will. I'm not proposing that, just illustrating that the data is relative to a process and the more we understand and are able control that process, the more we can manipulate what the data will look like (hopefully a nice no slope line around 0 cases eventually).

Take newtonian mechanics. If I throw a ball in the air I have great well tested models that will predict its behaviors. Because I know all that information so well, I can introduce another ball and using the same model, make the balls intersect in the air in a way the primary ball has now skewed from it's natural progression that the initial model projected. A new holistic model now needs to account for the intervention of the balls. They may still use the same underlying mechanics but their interactions can result in behaviors you weren't initially accounting for because there was no sort of intervention before.

Exponential growth is not an absolute requirement."

My Data Science Manifesto from a Self Taught Data Scientist,"As a stats professor who teaches DS, your point about evaluation is especially important with the rise in generative models. It was already a challenge getting DS students to think critically about the *practical* performance of their models before LLMs, and now model evaluation more important than ever.

While I agree that you don‚Äôt need to memorize all the statistical models and tests as long as you‚Äôre aware of where to find them and how to use them, I‚Äôll add that it‚Äôs equally important to know *when* to reach for them. Too many students struggle with recognizing when a problem calls for statistical testing rather than classification. When all you know is ML, everything looks like a prediction problem.

And communication!!! If you can‚Äôt explain the relevance of your results to laypeople, you‚Äôre not going to be an effective data scientist."

"The other big thing you didn't mention is recognizing the importance and different ways to clean and prepare data. Honestly, it shouldn't need to be said, but I just worked under a senior data scientist on a consulting gig that didn't think that step was important at all. I literally facepalmed watching them train a model on a dataset with over 50% null values and duplicates. Understanding the actual meaning and importance behind ""garbage in, garbage out"" should be the absolute bare minimum for any DS","That's honestly part of what makes me good at my job, but at least for me, it's somewhat related to domain knowledge too. Bad data at my company is often 'hidden'. A vague example is, don't use data from March because there was a bug in some other part of the company. It's not obvious when just looking at the data that it's wrong, but I just happen to be in a unique position where I understand that a bug in one seemingly unrelated area can percolate through and cause bad data elsewhere."
"Cool story but I‚Äôm not sure what to make of it.

Your manifesto‚Äôs thesis hints at something among the lines of ‚Äútechnical/academic knowledge is not a prerequisite for professional success‚Äù, which is of course true but it‚Äôs kind of a mute point in terms of actionable recommendations since P(being a good DS | having technical skills) >>> P(being a good DS| not having technical skills). Context and domain knowledge are *much* easier and cheaper to obtain than specialized knowledge in advanced statistics, machine learning or programming. What you‚Äôre saying is not false or wrong (local to your experience) but I find it hard to generalize or extrapolate practical advice based off them.

I am a lead DS in big tech, I‚Äôve interviewed hundreds of people, and have worked and interacted directly with hundreds of others (so there‚Äôs a large selection bias in my sample towards heavily credentialed individuals) but in my experience, the most truly outstanding individuals are those that have a really large toolkit (solid technical skills), are rigorous thinkers (can handle ambiguous situations and frame them appropriately while recognizing caveats and trade offs), AND have solid domain context or experience that allows them to use the above in an *efficient* way to solve problems.

Yeah, to get a DS gig you don‚Äôt _need_ a PhD and you can  eventually be pretty decent at your job. I know plenty of DS generalists that add a ton of value to their teams. But 1) it is much harder to put your foot on the door if you don‚Äôt have a credible skill set and 2) your ceiling is much lower as there‚Äôs only so much you can do with wits and SQL. I don‚Äôt think asking for technical proficiency is just about ‚Äúgatekeeping‚Äù or a conspiracy from data scientists to appear collectively smart, it is just a good predictor of success.

That said, I agree that you don‚Äôt need to be an expert on every particular tool and technique. If I had to focus on something in particular, it is important to be a SQL wizard and to have solid foundations and a working intuition of statistical inference, probability, research design and statistical learning. Adding hands on knowledge of *any* modern programming language, then you‚Äôd be in the top 10% of data scientists anywhere.

(PS. I LOLed hard to the advice of knowing what a p-value is being the only important stats skill. That is just absurd. You cannot possibly understand what a p-value represents without a much deeper understanding of frequentist statistics. Trying to just memorize and blindly apply the text book definition of it has led to disastrous consequences in our profession and science at large.)","Bro i agree. It's really dangerous to only emphasize knowing about p-values for DS: a lot of other materials in statistics are really important.


You can't conclude that your hypothesis is correct just because you get a p-value<0.05."
"As someone who is partially self taught, partially formally educated, has data science projects under my belt, and currently manages a mixed team of data scientists, data engineers, and analytical consultants - 100% back all of this.",Same. ü•π
"Dude has 10 years of experience and got into the industry when barrier to entry weren‚Äôt so high. Then says lol u dont need much to get in. My guy u got in during the boom of data science then learned how to do the job by doing it.


If you take a guy with 0 experience then put them into today‚Äôs job market they wont make it. I agree you dont need advanced math, but you for sure need to know something about how the models work. Else you become a .fit .predicts monkey. 

As for statistics, no it definitely is critical. A lot of advanced data science role requires a strong understanding of statistics. Saying advanced statistics is a very subjective statement. When people say ‚Äúdo i need to know statistics‚Äù they usually mean do i need to know how to calculate the probability of an event, do i need to bother understanding what bayes theorem means. Do i need to bother with how actual optimization is done.

This isnt to gate-keep, i will be the first person to hate on these people. But dont expect the judgement of a guy who worked 10 years ago, and got promoted through an internal promotion during the peak era of data science to be your expectation of how you enter this field or you‚Äôre gonna be disappointed. You can be amazing and very talented and still not get a job.","I thought it was interesting that OP describes themselves as self-taught when their degree is super relevant (has all the math/analytical skills needed) + they worked as a Data Analyst - nothing more prevalent for becoming a DS than a STEM degree -> DA -> DS, I think it is the most common advice or pathway

*sigh* yet another case of OP embellishing for whatever reason"
"Worked at a Fortune 100 FAANG-ish tech company and all 20 of their production models built by the ‚ÄúAI‚Äù team were XGBoost evaluated using the same confusion matrix. 

IMO the most underrated skill set in DS not talked about enough in this sub is writing production Python code. Being able to build your own data pipelines and resolve APIs, automate data ingestion, create alerts and observability for what you‚Äôre doing is more important than an academic understanding of the topics you mentioned.","It does depend on your company, and whether or not those responsibilities fall on you, but in general, I agree it's almost always better if you can implement an end to end solution yourself. The handover to other teams is actually where a lot of projects fail."
"This is one of the reasons, why so many data science projects fail. There are just too many Bootcamp data scientists around. It's not about gatekeeping, it's about experience and fundamentals. The point is that a lot of the ""basic"" boring stuff is enforced by academia and skipped by a lot of self taught data scientists because that's the hardest part. And yes it makes a difference. 

I don't claim self-taught data scientists are all bad, but I worked with quite some and on average they are pretty bad. Often they don't understand statistics and basic computer science stuff. 

But I agree with one thing: Most companies aren't ready for data science and therefore it does often not make any difference in practice.","I don't advocate for bootcamps either to be honest. I've honestly never worked with a bootcamp data scientist, but I can see how they have misplaced incentives, and result in over confidence. I have worked with many smart DS's and see projects fail for somewhat of the opposite reason. Trying to re-invent the wheel and try and take on too much at one time, instead of pursuing a simpler solution that gets you 95% of the results with 10% of the complexity."
"> I'd like to add that you can almost certainly do all this in 2-3 years vs the 5 it took me. I wasted a lot of time spinning my wheels. ChatGPT is also a great resource that could also increase your learning speed.

This is interesting because in my experience dealing with early career data workers the real reason why they‚Äôre spinning their wheels is BECAUSE they rely far too heavily on chatGPT. Instead of learning the tools they need they‚Äôre spending all their time learning how to use chatGPT to solve their problems and can‚Äôt really do anything creative or off-the-cuff.","Yeah I‚Äôm skeptical of that bit. I think it can be useful as a sounding board when working through a problem, but it takes discipline not to trust it and make sure you verify everything."
"It sounds like you got lucky that your company promoted you internally. I don't think you would have been competitive against other candidates, and it sounds like you didn't have a real interview that would have tested your knowledge on the stuff you've forgotten","As someone who followed a similar path into DS I agree that‚Äôs probably true, but to the OP‚Äôs point trying to pivot to a new role within a company is a totally valid way to get into the work you want to be doing (though you may have to target companies open to that type of internal mobility).

Maybe it‚Äôs true they wouldn‚Äôt have interviewed as well at other companies asking a bunch of knockout-type questions, but to me that‚Äôs more of an indictment of hiring processes that overlook candidates who would be effective and additive to a DS organizations by over indexing on the minutia and missing practical experience and intrinsic motivation."
Im kind of skeptical about how little you seem to claim we can know and yet be employed over other people who may know way more rhan us,[deleted]
"thanks for your post. i've been struggling with the ""you need all this specific mathematical knowledge"" part for awhile now. I am an undergrad in bio but just completely my MS in bioinformatics. i'd like to go into DS should the computational biology route not work out.","Your path is definitely doable. My degree in biochemistry and PhD in computational biology.
Now I'm a data engineer working on both DE, DS and comp bio areas all at the same time."
"Agree with a lot of it; however, I think you are underselling two things. 

1.) Domain knowledge is huge. Sounds like you have been at your company for a while and were exposed to many different data sets. That's likely why you are mor productive. 
2.) having a good understanding of the fundamentals of linear algebra, calculus, stats/probability is easy for an engineer or many STEM majors. It is not easy for folks outside of STEM.","Well your first point is kind of the point of the second half of the post. Domain knowledge is huge, so getting that while learning can get your foot in doors you would never get in without it. Your second point is true. I think you have to have good problem solving skills and be somewhat naturally math minded, but the barrier is more along the lines of ""decently good at math on an undergrad level"", which is considerably lower than what's messaged here and in industry."
"Understanding statistical concepts in greater detail can be salient for quality and efficiency of work, and meaningfulness of results. 

If you are outperforming coworkers with DS-related PHD's, that moreso suggests they don't fare well themselves. 

Good luck, keep learning.","They were extremely intelligent, technical, and had great soft skills as well. They came into the company without enough real world experience. They tried to make paradigm shifts, when that rarely works in the real world. They stayed at the company for around 2 years, and very little was actually completed. I'm sure if they were to start over at my company knowing what they know now, they would be highly successful (although maybe bored)."
"The member of the DS team with the most domain knowledge is incredibly valuable, as well as the individual who has relationships across the company. These backgrounds are essential and work great in tandem with the 'Theorists'. Also, DS/ML has so much bullshit in it its not hard to be better then the median coworker. If the takeaway is that you can get a ""Data Scientist"" title and be a productive team member from an analytics background and a superficial understanding of math, then I agree wholeheartedly. 

However, this can and often does stunt your career. Your value is context dependent: if you change industries or even companies the ramp up time may be... contrary to the expectations of your title. 

If you have technical depth you can learn so much faster as you change industries and fields, and advance in your career in general. This helps with promotions, raises, and leadership, especially hiring (as its hard to tell the BS from the real shit if you don't have a similarly strong background).

If you are serious about DS/ML as a lifetime career with earning potential and job safety, it makes more sense to get a masters for a couple years than spend 5 years as an analyst and a few more proving yourself as a DS.","I have to say I agree with this take, from a DA/SME >> DS pipeliner who wants to switch domains towards more stats-heavy DS but not particularly interested in ML.

I'm finding myself at a crossroads: move towards Builder as an AE or flesh out the depth of math/stats rigor to find confidence and fit as a DS. My issue is that I'm 75% certain that a technical Master's program is not for me; I'm just going to get bored and feel trapped. I know that I need to broaden my technical horizons with requisite rigor, but also need to find the right path to achieve that."
"Thanks for sharing OP. 

I‚Äôve been a DA for 1.5yrs with all my prior experience in Marketing/ Market Research, and the goal of eventually transitioning into a DS role. Half way through a Data Analytics masters programme, which helped me learn coding and basic stats & ML concepts, now realising I‚Äôm not learning much from it anymore.

I‚Äôm considering my next steps. My takeaway from this post is to take advantage of the shit ton of data I have access to as a DA at work, do things with it, and get closer to DS projects. That‚Äôs certainly doable with my current team structure.","Not OP, but I would consider this a very good plan if I were in your shoes. Internal transfer/promotion is a pretty good (maybe the best?) way to break into the field right now. It may be worth talking to your direct manager and discussing your career goals, they may be able to help you identify potential opportunities for growth in these areas.

Incidentally, I‚Äôve been meaning to write a post about making the ‚Äúdo things with your data‚Äù part more concrete. The head of our department recently shared his perspective on it and it was like a light turned on for me."
"I don‚Äôt fully agree with this, but we can agree to disagree. Mostly I think that your experience with your company can be extremely different from other companies and other situations where you do need more than the basic amount of knowledge to get the job.

An example could be some industries require you to fully understand the intricacies of the mathematics of your model in order to make improvements beyond gradient descent. Anything NN or even something like customizing loss functions for better learning/fit requires something beyond the basics, and I do think the second one comes up quite a bit if you work for a developed data science team

Your method is a bit more scrappy and requires a level of base architecture to actually do, which thankfully for you(and many of us tbh), other data scientists have been making available for advanced data analysts to work with.  It‚Äôs like not knowing how a computer works and only knowing the specs make this part of the computer go faster. There‚Äôs a gap that can cause issues in some cases.","I would consider customized loss function part of the 'know how to evaluate' section and something that you should 'master', as it does come up all the time."
"I think you make great points but I think what makes the difference between a good data scientist vs great data scientist is being able to explain what you did in laymen‚Äôs terms. Essentially you need to be able to ELI5 on data sets and models for the company to nod its head at what you are doing. 

I think your background gives you that ability since you came from a non traditional data science background and learned from scratch. Very few new grads and even entry level folks know to do that. You don‚Äôt need to be great at math or great at building the models but if you understand it enough and can explain it back to senior leaders, you‚Äôll move quickly up the chain.","There is a natural urge to make your presentations as technical as possible, because you want to feel smart. I did this a little bit at first out of insecurity and feeling like I needed to prove myself. I've found doing the exact opposite is far more effective. Breaking concepts down as simple as possible and only introducing technicality as needed, has lead to much more enthusiasm from management, which results in my work getting implemented at a much higher rate than those who keep presentations complicated."
"I think the requirements vary a lot by location. I find myself in the opposite end of the spectrum where I just finished my PhD in physics and trying to get my first job. I‚Äôm based in the Middle East where the word PhD (and even masters) doesn‚Äôt exist in any job ad (and probably actually hurts your chances). The requirements for a DS role (not junior, not senior, simply DS) are always BS + 5 years and then a list of every possible ML/AI model and python package in existence. When I check out job ads in my home country in Europe, all require MS + 5 or PhD with usually a less intimidating list of specifics. Seems like ‚Äúgatekeeping‚Äù can have different flavors depending on which market you‚Äôre in.","this is also very frustrating because models and packages is something that can be easily learned on the job, but after experience in the industry I see this reflects how they want you to be comfortable working with real world problems and implementing very quickly solutions and that they don't have the time, or even money that a more research focused DS brings."
"This was painful to read ‚Äì an ode to mediocrity‚Ä¶

I am a data scientist at a global corporation and I frequently use graduate level statistics at my work (advanced time series, bayesian methods etc.), I also read research papers and implement them it they are not a available for Python.

Quantitative Analysts literally code very complex research papers in C++. My daughter (who is a 24yo university student) is doing this at a huge investment bank as an intern‚Ä¶ imagine their principal data scientists‚Ä¶

Digital native e-commerce companies like Zalando have armies of very highly skilled PhD-s to do applied research.

Newbies, stay away from this terrible advice. See also: [There is no place for model.fit() Data Scientists](https://medium.com/@mLiebig_/there-is-no-place-for-model-fit-data-scientists-401f63bae7fb)","I understand the sentiment but most of us aren't working at huge investment banks or global corps.

The reality is most of us also aren't writing complex research papers etc.

We work with PhDs in the company I work for but they are purely assigned to cutting edge research, while the general DS team works on automation and value add projects."
"Which software/languages do you recommend people get training or certificates for?

SQL, Tableau ... anything else?","I'm assuming you're talking about becoming a data analyst. As for certs, none. No one cares about those any more. To get a data analyst job get good at SQL and some sort of data viz (Tableau, power BI, whatever). Some basic python would be a big plus.

Edit: y'all are right that linear regression is certainly a form of statistical learning. I think the main reason I instinctively think of it as being ""not machine learning"" is that it has a simple closed-form solution--so the ""machine"" part of statistical learning with linear regression is unnecessary. The same can't be said for a lot of other algorithms that are more comfortably referred to as ""machine learning"", you know?","It is machine learning, it's just the simplest kind there is.

So you can have 10 models and you start with linear and work your way up to neural nets and other fancy stuff. Neural networks are linear regression with an activation function slapped to it.

But it's a meme, so I'm probably looking too deep"
Better to err on the side of caution.,AI is evolving threat detection systems.
Can you really build a model which correctly detects tigers but detects this as not being a tiger?,"This isn't the worst example. On the Twitter thread that showed this humorous image, someone also gave an example of AI that was able to tell wolves from dogs by looking at whether or not they were standing in snow...

AI only looks at correlations, and the model builders often celebrate too early and fool themselves.

An object with a shadow overcast would require an insane amount of diverse training data to distinguish it. I bet this is also something self driving cars are struggling with the most."

"Actually, the stripes are painted on - they don't come from the shadows of the bars. The only shadow is the large swath on his face and upper foreleg.

I don't know how this relates to data science.","Nice catch! The context here is that there are no bar shadows on the ground next to the dog, it‚Äôs a really hard problem to train."

"I was about to ask this question yesterday tbh but I didn't have enough karmas to do so :(

I completed my master's in DS in 2019 and for the past 4 years, I have worked in 3 different companies hoping to get some actual DS work, but all I end up doing is reporting and dashboarding and a bit of DE.

I have come to a point where I realize I may never get any DS work and I should just pivot to DE instead.","I am right there with you. During an interview, you can ask them to be transparent with your job duties, but it means nothing until you're actually on the job. I am a DS who mainly does Analyst work with a logistic regression model here and there."
"When I was hired as a data scientist in the training department at Star Health, this is the list of tasks that were assigned to me:

* Make charts for presentations
* Learn about the Learning Management System (LMS) \[functionalities, content management, etc.\] and help others in the whole company learn how to use it \[tougher than it sounds, most were computer-illiterate\]
* Handle the invoices received from e-learning service providers and follow up with Accounts on whether the invoices were cleared
* Talk with e-learning vendors, specifically bargaining (ugh!)

As if this wasn't enough, next came another excruciatingly disgusting work: the company was building a training academy and the whole training department was to shift there. I had to follow up with the interior designers and the builder about the completion of the work. That's the work of the Administration department, isn't it? I'd often remark to my supportive colleagues that I just didn't paint the place; I seem to have done everything else. The company treated me like a jackass.

The main problem was that they never acknowledged my introversion, English fluency, voracious reading habit, grammatical perfection and my writing ability. I tried my best to articulate to everyone around, but they were far more content in undermining me. The icing on the cake: I was also used for creating calendar invites and hosting Zoom meetings. Exactly what executive assistants should be doing. The irony was that we had a receptionist, but I was still the one doing it.

That was the last straw for me. I had joined in February 2020 and had wanted to leave in July 2020, but the pandemic-induced slowdown meant that there were no jobs available in the market (in India, at least). Besides, I was looking for an opportunity as a content writer rather than as a data science professional (yeah, I finally decided to go mainstream with my passion).

After a year and a half of job hunting, I finally landed one and I happily resigned from Star in January 2022. People at Star were baffled; some of them still call me for clarifications on the LMS and I angrily respond that ""I resigned from your shithole company long back. Stop calling me."" Some of them still assume that I would be at Star forever. The fact that Star Health has people who spend their entire career at one company is a bummer. This ""taken-for-granted"" attitude is what irked me the most.

Thankfully, my current company [https://examroom.ai/](https://examroom.ai/) is heaven. I'm ready to go over and above for them as they differ from my previous employer in critical aspect: they accept me for who I am. They embrace my introversion. They provide flexible timings, which is a boon for writers like me. My advice to you is this: work at a place where you are respected. It's sad that I am getting this respect only at the age of 29, 7 years after I entered the workforce, but I'm thankful that I'm at least getting it now.",L„Öì„Öã

"Every data scientist at a senior level that I have spoken to: ""I'm a data scientist at xxxx but I wouldn't consider what I do as data science""","Yeah I think this is what the tweet is getting at. DS is too broad for someone with any claim to expertise would strongly identify as an 'expert data scientist'.

"The most insufferable woman I ever met was a ‚Äúdata scientist.‚Äù I was at a bar in San Francisco known to be a hangout spot for UCSF nurses and doctors. She approaches me at the bar and we start talking but it was immediately odd and confrontational. She flat out asked me  what I thought she did for a living and I guessed ‚Äúnurse practitioner in onco or neuro departments‚Äù (which UCSF is heavy with). It was a shot in the dark but I figured if I was very specific and correct it would be funny.

She audibly scoffed and I thought I had maybe insulted a physician (which is fair, the nurse/doctor divide is unnecessarily gendered) but instead she acted all incredulous and indignant, called a friend over, and was like ‚Äúthis guy thinks I‚Äôm just a nurse.‚Äù

After some back and forth about how ‚Äújust a nurse‚Äù seemed like a more condescending position than assuming someone was a nurse‚Ä¶ she finally says something like ‚Äúhoney, I‚Äôm a DATA SCIENTIST.‚Äù

By this point I knew I was going to keep poking the bear. I asked her where she published her methods or results, what company she worked for (some advertising leads/marketing shop, iirc), and what kind of data she worked with. It was becoming apparent that she was another data science bootcamp attendee that were flooding SF at the time (2017ish). She replied to the last question with ‚Äúdata is data, it‚Äôs all just math.‚Äù 

After some more back and forth about how a table of values on a persons last 5 web searches, ad engagements, or magazine subscriptions is a helluva lot different than time series sensor data from a device, genomic data from a targeted/functional assay,  or spatial/geo data - she started to get more‚Ä¶ coquettish? She finally asked what I do and I replied ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a nurse.‚Äù I ended explaining that I wasn‚Äôt a nurse (just a grad student in bioinformatics) but my mother was a nurse and that I suggest she look at some of the data around what a nurse practitioner at UCSF makes.",And I take it all back.

I don't think anything about OP's post indicated that they didn't talk about ML or AI-type shit.  Just how they sold themself.

How many coding assessments did you have you take?,"A ton.

I think the worst was 3 separate assessments for 1 job.

My impression, though, was that interviews with managers mattered more than assessment performance. Most companies seemed to just ask for a ""thumbs up / thumbs down"" from the test-givers and really just use them to filter out people that failed.

I panicked an absolutely bombed one early on, but still got an offer because the executive liked me."
"I just don‚Äôt understand why the whole interview is such a performance in finding out what the role is and what they want? Why must I try and show that I could sniff out exactly what their problems are that need solving from a short paragraph of skills requirements on the job listing before the interview, and if I don‚Äôt then Im somehow incompetent and have failed the interview already? 
Why can‚Äôt they just say what their problem is at the start of the interview and I‚Äôll say oh yes I‚Äôve come across something similar and I‚Äôve handled it this way. Cool. Done.","Because that‚Äôs what the actual job is like. You‚Äôre working with stakeholders who either don‚Äôt know exactly what problem they need solved, or they think they know but it‚Äôs the wrong thing. A big part of this job is not just solving the problem but often identifying the real problem in the first place."
"Seconding the above questions for more detail. 
What was the online program / cert? 

What geographic area where the offers were made / firms are located?","Answering on OP's behalf, he took a harvardX course and he is working remotely(US)"

I'm also a DS with an unusual degree (Journalism) and got a job and grew quickly at the role without too much fuss after an online program+some industry experience.

Do you require any experience or education level?"
"Too good to be true or OP is extremely lucky, since he does not have a proper background or has a very limited work experience for the mentioned salaries. 

Above average companies have STEM or work experience as criterion in their applicant tracking system. It is very difficult for OP's background to pass them (approx. 5%). Since OP does not mention any specific project or experience, I do not see any reason to pay him this much. Even if I am gonna pay these amounts, I would go for a fresh and bright graduate from a STEM program.","I got multiple 6 figure offers 3 years ago when I only had 2 years of analytics experience, a liberal arts degree, and had finished only a few courses for my MSDS.

Regression towards the mean and the gamblers fallacy seem contradictory.

[My thoughts exactly](https://new.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/1dd7dgr/rant_excel_and_opening_csv_files/), I guess they're too busy thinking of ways to extract money from Azure and machine learning.

Microsoft is the biggest software company in the world and Excel is their killer app. Just think of the cumulative time wasted on explaining basic features like opening a file to new staff members in offices around the world. üòê It's ridiculous really."
I have a product code like 12.30. Both tried to convert it into 12.3. Most of the time these helps dont really help. I know what I am trying dont correct me.,"We have the same thing for clinical trials with participant IDs with leading zeros, `0012345` becomes `12345`. Really annoying because this breaks merging the data at a later point."
Ok this is a meme but Excel is infuriating because of this. I open some csv directly on VS Code and replace characters just so I don‚Äôt need to deal with this bullshit,Fuck it I‚Äôm using TextEdit
"To understand why this does happen in Excel you need to understand how Microsoft thinks. When Microsoft does something, they do it because they think the majority of people will need it this exact way, the problem is a lot of us aren't like the regular user but instead we have a bit more knowledge when it comes to data, luckily tho since we are more familiar with software we also know how to import data correctly in Excel, which is marking every column as text because only then will excel not convert it to whatever excel thinks ""this should be right"".

But ofc MS also sometimes removes functionalities that regular and advanced users need/use, best example is probably opening CSV-Files in excel. Usually when you opened it from the explorer, the import dialog immediately showed up where you can define which column is what, whats the text identifier and whats the separator. Now this doesn't work anymore, you either have to have Excel already open and use the Open File Dialog to get shown the import wizard or you open it via the file itself and then go to Data and call the import wizard from there.

But yeah most of the time MS thinks "">80% of our users will use it and have no problem and the rest can just go f*ck themselves"", that's also why windows updates by default is configured the way it is configured, to make sure the average user gets their updates in time and it installs it but you can disable automatic updates if you know how.",How do you disable automatic updates? It's not doable for Win10 and onwards AFAIK.
"The best way of resolving this is to import data using PowerQuery, which is built into Excel.  It takes a little getting used to, but it is honestly Excel's best feature.",It frickin rocks
"Libreoffice Calc took some getting used to because it truly feels like the temu version of excel, but it gets the job done in most cases","Sadly, Calc does the same thing üôÅ

Try to enter a large number or a date into a cell, and Calc will not save that number or date, but the value that results from interpreting that number or date.
You can stop Calc from doing so, but that renders Calc useless because all inputs will get saved as text.

E.g. paste a bunch of SHA1 checksums into Calc. Some will be interpreted as text (because they contain characters), while others will be stripped of leasing zeros and/or converted to scientific notation.

Or, enter a date in DD.MM.YY format into a cell that was formatted as ""date DD.MM.YY"". Calc _will_ interpret the date as MM.DD.YY and save it as DD.MM.YY with the days and month switched! There is no way to see what the user initially pasted. That information is just lost forever.

Or, open a Calc document that uses a dot as decimal separator on a PC that uses a language with a comma as decimal separator. Lots of fun is to be had in multilingual environments.

Not saying that LibreOffice is worse than MS Office. But, surprisingly, the developers decided to make LibreOffice behave as badly as MS Office to present MS Office users a familiar environment üôÅ"

"At the risk of sounding old, this post is but one example why Excel should not be used in science, be it in research or industry.

Excel is office spreadsheet software not intended for scientific data analysis. Excel hides/obfuscates data, incorrectly displays data, its formulas are horrid and impossible to read, it incorrectly implements statistical methods (Microsoft even has technical bulletins admitting this), produces terrible data visualizations, and it allows and encourages users to carry out poor data management practices (e.g., such as hiding columns or mixing raw data with intermediate outputs in the same sheet). All these factors mean that Excel is a serious hindrance to reproducible data science and analysis.

Yes, Excel continues to be used because it is ubiquitous and opens the doors of data analysis to non-coders, but my point stands. Whenever I receive another analyst's work in Excel with a request to repeat or extend their analysis, I get a shiver down my spine.","Yes, currently working with someone who does the majority of their work in excel and similar GUI tools. I once watched in horror how they prepared important data by clicking a gazillion of buttons, marking bits and pieces across various spreadsheets and copy pasting it around. 

Sure enough when I double checked some of it, it was all wrong."
Now why does Excel see 1.27 as 12.72 but 0.7085 as '0.7085',My guess is that whoever made the meme did it manually to exaggerate the issue. I know we've all seen this happen but I think this example is joking about how bad it can be
Or you can kiss go data\from file and set import's metadata,Right so many people are complaining here but I don't have this problem. Is everyone just double clicking csv's rather than importing the data lol

My Guide To Writing A Killer Cover Letter,Guide to writing a cover letter: don't waste your time writing a cover letter
"This looks like a great guide but unfortunately as a tech recruiter I can tell you 99% of the time cover letters are not read. 

It is much better to spend time ensuring your CV is clearly laid out, to the point, and visually pleasing. If a reader has to figure out what is going on in your CV it is not a good CV. A person must be able to look at your CV and immediately know what is going on, it should not have to be deciphered.

Bigger company recruiters don‚Äôt have time to read cover letters. Smaller companies/startups might do, but at that point you‚Äôre better off finding the hiring manager and/or recruiter on LinkedIn and dropping them a message to indicate your interest - you‚Äôll stand out more.","So, why ask for a cover letter?"
"Good guide but...

Has anybody who actually interviews people read the cover letters or even look at it? I've done interviewing before and I've never even seen the cover letter. If this only gets to HR then it's value is pretty limited. I've additionally only seen one company actually reference my cover letter in an interview.

Additionally, I strongly disagree with this sentiment: ""It's better to apply for five relevant positions with a complementing cover letter than to apply for fifty positions without any background research."" Applying to jobs is a numbers game in my and my colleagues experience. Spending an excess amount of time when in all likelihood they toss your application in <2 minutes isn't efficient.","I work in a political, mission driven environment. We read resumes because we want to make sure you know what you're getting into and we need to make sure that you are aligned with our mission. 

We take folks from other industries all the time just fine, even if you don't have domain specific experience, but we want to make sure you know what we do and want to be part of it. Its hard to put you in front of stakeholders if you aren't on board with what we do. I know I came in from a marketing analytics role and no political background and have had a lot of success.

We explicitly say that the cover letter is factored into our decision in the posting and give instructions for what we're looking for. 

When you have 20 qualified candidates you want to interview, its easier to toss 5 because they didn't address our questions in their cover letter and interview 15 candidates instead. Reading a cover letter and tossing takes 2-3 minutes... each interview takes a lot of time to execute."
Guide to writing a cover letter: don't waste your time writing a cover letter,"I was about to come in here to make this same comment. As a hiring manager there's very little that you can say in a cover letter that will sway me. Honestly most of the time no one reads them. We're looking at your resume to start off, if there's something good there I'll dig deeper.

The only time I could see it really having a large impact is if you're transitioning career areas or you're trying to explain something concerning on your resume. In either of those cases keep it short and sweet. I will almost certainly read a paragraph explaining gaps in your resume or irrelevant experience."
"I haven't written a cover letter in years, and I don't plan on doing so any time soon.",[deleted]
My dude wrote a thesis on how to write a useless document.,LOL
"Companies should do away with cover letters. The best ones are written by third party professionals. Three things I don‚Äôt usually care about when shortlisting resumes:
1. Cover Letters
2. Academic degrees
3. Experience more than 5 years ago","> Companies should do away with cover letters. 

I literally just asked my coworkers (all DS), it is an automatic pass for them. Same for me, will not bother with a job if it needs one. Not sure if it is widely held opinion, but it seems to be pervasive."
Great guide. Thanks for sharing,Thanks for reading
"Great write up, but the best way to secure a data science job is to include a link to your GitHub account so we can see some of your work. That'll get you a lot more calls than a cover letter.","Best way is to already have a DS job and then click ""I'm looking"" on LinkedIn and wait for the recruiter messages to come"
"In a course I had around 10 years ago, an instructor gave us a very simple mnemonic way to write cover letters: the same as a postcard to our grandma.

1- Hello grandma.

2- I hope you're doing well.

3- I'm doing very well over here.

4- I can't wait to see you again and play bridge together.

5- Kisses

\-------------------

1- Know who you are sending the letter to, good formula to start with.

2- Show that you researched the company and the role and that you are actually interested in it. Identify what they do and why it matters

3- Talk about what's relevant about you with respect to what you identified above. Insist more on personality and traits than skills: they also have your resumee so avoid redundancy.

4- Talk about what you will bring to the company. Show that you understand what they need and that you already constructively project yourself in the role.

5- Politeness formula to end

And just like a postcard: keep it short and to the point.

\-----------------

This shit is so good, I never had to look again at my notes from this course, never forgot how to make one, and everytime some friends showed me cover letters they wrote they were way worse than mines. It also make it a very simple and efficient process to write one. You know exactly what you need to research, what you need to write and what you're trying to convey when writing it.",Love this
"Everyone out here whining about how cover letters suck but this one of the best, most impressive guides I have ever seen. Thank you OP",Ha that means a lot. Seriously. Took about 5 weeks to write. Glad you found it helpful
Amazing job! Thanks for sharing,Thank you for reading!
Would you say that following the old rule of thumb of flesche Kincaid 8 or lower is appropriate for cover letters?,Yeah try to make it as readable as possible! Though also mirror the words used in the job description
"Great overall; I would keep an eye on the length though. For a more senior position where there won‚Äôt be tons of qualified applicants, longer letters can work, but I don‚Äôt have time to read 100 letters this long ;)

In general, a short letter with relevant content shows great communication skills and capacity to isolate the important.

Anyways, thanks for sharing!",Very valid point - the shorter the better

"I've been wondering- is it possible to train a model to write a cover letter for you? I know there's stuff like GPT-3, but I honestly have no idea how it works and what sort of data you'd need or even how it's set up","Well, looks like you were right long before we knew"

"There are different approaches to cover letter, but my goal was show what can't be conveyed in the resume - passion for data science. I demonstrate it through a personal narrative approach. Have had multiple hiring managers tell me it's one of the best they've ever read. Do something different to stick out from all the other 1000 boring cover letters.",There's no one way - do what works for you :)
This is some great (and thorough) content. Thanks for sharing!,Thanks for reading
Who even writes cover letter anymore?,"Software. People use AI to write cover letters, and companies use AI to read cover letters.

Expectation vs reality,[deleted]
[deleted],Major truth.
"Ok for real tho, as someone new to the field is this what machine learning is? I always heard and thought it was some fancy AI electrical neuroscience shit, and now that I'm actually learning about it it's just... statistics? Which I'm actually cool with I'm loving it, but why the name? I'm almost at the end of an intro to machine learning book and none of it is much more advanced than what I learnt in the maths courses of my chemical engineering degree. We'd write some equations, do some optimizations, build models, do a linear regression or whatever and write some code in R or Matlab, and we just called it stats or optimisation. So far I've seen no evidence that machines are learning anything?",Because statistics has been around for a long time and machine learning/AI/Black magic wizardry sounds like a new concept so people are more willing to engage in what is seen as forward thinking and fresh
[deleted],And I'm highlighting numbers if they're above/below goals and typing out things that anyone could find in dashboards if they looked at them...
Reminds me of my ignorant manager when I tell him that the analytics project I'm working on is based on statistics and not ML :(,So next time you're telling him that it's based on ML?
This is so truth that I think I'm wasting my time doing a Master's in CS and should change to Applied Maths instead.,Maths is useful in most science and engineering fields but the focus is different from CS.
"Maybe think of machine learning as stats + computer science. 
Imagine your problem is building a self driving car and you're trying to do collision detection. The dataset you have is rgb 1080p video at 60fps for 3 seconds. For simplicity's sake let's assume you have 1 million of these examples (833 hours or so?) because the problem is complex and you'd like to get a really accurate result, learning from the data set. So your dataset is 1 million x (3 x 1920 x 1080 x 60 x 3)  - about 1 million samples of 1 billion features/independent variables. Assume a lower bound of each feature taking 1 Byte to store you have about 1 Petabyte of data. How do you solve the various problems arising from time and spacial complexity? Statistical concepts are definitely important, but stats alone won't solve this problem. The recent rise of neural nets is due to dramatic technology advances since the middle of the last century, making learning possible in a reasonable amount of time.

Edit: formatting, arithmetic.","But isn‚Äôt that argument also true of things like linear regression? Before computers, that was often too laborious to do manually and people drew lines literally by eye. As others have pointed out, neural nets are essentially ‚Äújust‚Äù nested logistic regression. That‚Äôs not to say I disagree that machine learning is stats + comp sci, but I think you can argue the two have gone hand in hand for far longer than that."
[removed],How do you check the convergent and discriminant validity a dataset using an SQL query?
"The thing is that ML is a superset of stats and you can't really understand ML if you're not already well versed in stats. 

You can learn how to use tools that other people created to train and deploy models and call yourself a ""ML engineer"" but you will never understand in depth what the science of ML is about and how it differs to classical stats. 

That said, the vast majority of self-proclaimed ML ""experts"" out there are phoneys.",">The thing is that ML is a superset of stats and you can't really understand ML if you're not already well versed in stats. 

ML is not a superset of stats. It's a new hybrid field where  algorithms that learn from data, computer programming and statistical models overlap."
 To continue down this path... Statistics is just math. And math is just counting. It‚Äôs a pointless exercise..,"Math isn‚Äôt just counting. Calculating, quantifying, maybe, but definitely not counting."
Me showing off a suspiciously well-performing model [OC],"At a corporate presentation a consultant showcased how our business can use 'AI' themselves in a BI Tool. He classified an extreme unbalanced dataset and got 96% acc which ist exactly the proportion of the largest category.

But when no one knows about, 96% sounds massive. The Business was amazed."

Confirmation bias is a very real thing. Wouldn't doubt it for a second. It happens in all areas. Look up the file drawer effect. Scary stuff.,"I've heard about confirmation bias too, so this sounds right to me"
"They're just describing Bayesian reasoning. 

Management has priors. Even a weak analysis that confirms their priors strengthens them. 

Evidence that goes against management's priors won't change their priors unless it's particularly strong, so management has to make sure the evidence is strong.","This is very true. However, could you rephrase it in frequentist terms?"
"The problem with only providing data driven confirmation of management is they can easily question whether data driven analytics is needed.

After finding and double checking insights that challenge the status quo, I search for a ""champion"" in the management side to broach my initial results with - the higher up the better, with C-Suite being the best. If my stats and data can back up the research, I can at least *germinate* the challenging idea in their minds. The strategy here is to not drop a bombshell on management but slowly disseminate information to them, preferably from someone inside management. This allows me to present my challenging findings sandwiched between more digestible insights. Doesn't always work out but it's better to coach people to expect bad/challenging news rather than surprising them with it.

Finally, its a numbers game. Can you really expect 100% of your data driven insights to be actioned upon without question? It's possible that your insights themselves are driven by limited data or knowledge or both.","High-quality post right here. I've never been deliberate about doing what you've laid out here, but in retrospect, the most success I've had are the times that resembled it. 

In fact, I can think of a couple times when the situation resolved itself because the leadership heard about my data from so many vectors that they came to my recommended conclusion on their own!"
"Not necessarily, but you must become good at comunicating bad news and proposing quality alternatives.",And understand the data / story behind it.
"This depends entirely on what level of management and the decisions involved post-analysis. Most C level execs that I‚Äôve worked with want what‚Äôs best for the company, regardless if the analysis supports their ‚Äúgut feeling‚Äù. 

VP level is typically where the headache is, I‚Äôve seen analyses ‚Äúredirected‚Äù once it doesn‚Äôt go their way. Something along the lines of ‚ÄúThis seems a bit wrong, maybe we should look at it from this angle.‚Äù And that happens until we arrive somewhere that an obscure and complex KPI is formulated for future use that they‚Äôre able to explain how well they‚Äôre doing. It‚Äôs funny because I‚Äôve never seen this actually work once it is reviewed by the C-Level. They shoot holes in it until the KPI is removed from production (maybe that‚Äôs the goal?). 

Directors don‚Äôt really care one way or the other and the stuff I work on is above the level of first line managers pay grade to care about, they‚Äôre too busy putting out daily fires.","Most c-suites I‚Äôve worked with want whatever answer allows them to maximize share buybacks before year end. 

In this system, VP‚Äôs and Directors become firefighters lacking agency. Many of their emails are forwarded nastygrams from c-suite asking why we‚Äôre chasing value as opposed to whatever dilutive metric investor relations promised the street that quarter."

"This has existed long before data scientists were even a thing.

Upper management has always had these traits in a lot of companies and there have always existed Yesmen who stoke their egos.

As a data scientist, you have the unique skill sets to prove or disprove assumptions using concrete data. But you have to be smart about how you approach these issues. No one likes a smart ass, especially not highly paid executives.

Upper management executives does not like being called out in the open. You have to take people into confidence and share your findings, making considerable effort to not present it as an refutation of their ideas. 

Yeah this can really suck and can be quite emotionally draining on a day-to-day basis. 

There will always exist egomaniacs who cannot fathom being wrong.

The choice we usually have it suck it up or walk away. There is always a better opportunity around the corner.","‚ÄúUpper management executives does not like being called out in the open‚Äù - 100% When I discover something undesirable I meet with my immediate stakeholders in private on what is going on to craft a narrative that still makes our team look good and that may mean discarding insights, although ideally we go for ‚Äúit‚Äôs bad‚Ä¶ but not that bad, or‚Ä¶ not because of us‚Äù."
"It just depends on where you work.

Asssumingly, OP (like me tbf) works in advising decisions without much consequence.

When they are likely wrong, I express more uncertainty or express sofly there might be beter options they could consider to cover myself. 

In your case, ethics are at play and you need to be able to sleep at night. I would rather have my analysis hated and even be fired than to validate an insight that would hurt anyone. I purposely pick jobs with low stakes because now I know that there is always some subjectivity in data analysis, knowingly or not, and I need to be able to disconnect from work."

Not a data science.. but I am a business intelligence analyst and need to regularly explain these concepts to people that dont normally deal with stats (usually they took a class a million years ago)... A p value tells you how likely an observed effect happened by random chance.. so smaller values means less likely it was random chance. Confidence intervals give you a range of values (to whatever confidence you like. usually 95% is calculated) where you are fairly certain the TRUE average exists... I'll go onto a brief synopsis of the central limit theorem from there if they look interested,"Let me nitpick here. It is impossible to know, in absolute terms, how likely an observed effect is to happen by random chance, because we don't know a probability distribution for what happens in the world. A p-value gives the probability of the data, conditional on the null hypothesis. A lot of people miss the ""conditional on the null hypothesis"" part, and think you're showing how likely the null hypothesis is to be true. I think it's crucial to communicate that this isn't true."
"Are you supposed to know what this is off the top of your head?

I think people like OP are just trying to say that some people say they are a professional of this area when they are not...  


OP should help their partners with discussions, so both of them have a better understanding of what a confidence interval really is. Instead, at the time of post, he is just acknowledging that fact to others so he can reaffirm that there is more complex doubts in the area of statistics that should be discussed so he can provide more profit to his boss."

"My mentality changed to this do what I can when I can attitude at work a couple years ago when a coworker passed away over a weekend from cancer. Conference call on Monday morning was to tell us that he had passed that weekend and that funeral arrangements would be announced shortly. At the end of the call our manager asked us to pass along any resumes that we might have to fill the position. Worked his ass off for year for an employer that tried to fill his position during the call that announced his passing. 

I waved bye bye to long hours and unpaid overtime. Now I fulfill my obligations for the pay band that I am at.","This happened where I work as well. Coworker died Friday evening. First thing Monday morning HR/part company owner went to my boss and told him not to place an ad for her job (small enough company that mgrs place own ads), that she already had someone lined up for it.

"These companies don‚Äôt give a fuck about you, you can always be replaced. Show up and do your job, nothing more, nothing less.

Recognize when there's a critical moment to step in and really help. But if it becomes fire drills all the time then step back and say what you cannot do.
"It's just a job. People should stop looking at it like it's the point of life. Caveman also didn't stress whether he's gonna do sales or data engineering. He just needed enough food. I know it's a bit naive view considering ""we live in a society"" but maybe it's good to keep in mind to destress every once in a while. Job isn't the meaning of life. Just do whatever you enjoy and make sure you have enough to eat and a roof. If they fire you, no problem, you are still alive.",Do I really need to spell out loud that if they fire you you won't have food or a roof for long ?
"I've said this countless times.

Work as if you have a yearly contract with a company. During that year, you will provide a value to the company for a wage, you will hopefully gain valuable experience that will help you land the next gig, and you will hopefully be challenged enough to stay. We will gain something valuable for the output you give, we will hopefully help you move on to the next gig, and challenge you enough to stay for the next year if all things work out.

If you go into a job thinking a for profit company owes you anything, then you're setting yourself up to fail. Everyone is replaceable and the business is not responsible for your life. If you want to take this as a justification for doing mediocre work, just doing enough to get by, half-assing it to pull a paycheck, and nothing more. Then it's going to be hard to justify your role during a cutback and equally hard for you to find the next gig. Do not set your future up for failure like that. Do a good job while you can, but do so understanding that in a year, you may be looking for the next challenge. Set yourself up to be the candidate people want.

Believe me. I've been there. I've been with companies that did mass layoffs every year. I've been in situations where the entire floor but me and 2 other employees are the only ones sitting at our desks sweating our asses off on whether we were about to be called into the office where the COO was cutting people left and right. I've been fired, frozen, just simply laid off because of redundancy. Shit happens.

I can tell you one thing for sure. When I was the top of my game. Like truly the top. That's when I was the last person in the room with a job. If I wasn't, I was in a new job within a week because word does get around if you are doing a piss poor job.",Are you sure it wasn‚Äôt just some balance of you being competent and at that mid range of acceptable salaries?

"Actually, I feel the same thing. (Btw, sorry for any grammar mistakes, english is not my first language)

For 4 years I worked for a huge bank in the IT department. As an Intern, I worked many, MANY extra hours for free (even more during the Pandemic). And even after I was promoted and climbed my way up to the Web Developer || position, I still worked ‚Äòtil late at night, almost every day. Eventually, after a few changes on the  teams, I was left by myself in a very important project, still maintaining the project‚Äôs webpage by myself (and knowing it was the homepage for that bank, it was A LOT of work). No matter how many times I asked for more developers and testers, no one listened and kept throwing more stuff for me to do (I did my job very well, so they just gave me more stuff everytime).

In the end, I was burnt out, with enough problems and projects for 3 or 4 people (and I know this number because after I left, they had to put 4 developers to do my job and, even though I left very extensive documentation, they still messed up a lot, and couldn‚Äôt deliver half of what I did), and very, very anxious, having anxiety attaks quite often. I was going to therapy during this whole thing but, still, I was a mess. And for what? When I quit they gaslighted me, talked badly of me behind my back and refused to admit I was overloaded with work (going as far as saying I wasn‚Äôt up for promotion anytime soon and ‚ÄúI still had a lot of self development to do in order to be promoted‚Äù).

So, no matter what, don‚Äôt overload yourself with work thinking the company will see you efforts. They won‚Äôt. And you‚Äôll end up in a massive burnout and stuck where you are. Your ‚Äúloyalty to the company‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt exist, because they won‚Äôt be loyal to you.","I agree. Always prioritize. If you can do a work in 2 days, say two weeks because you know the next task will be thrown on to you in a matter of a day. Play the games folks - there are no saints in corporate including me and you"
"100% I was critical in helping steer the course of my former company as my analysis showed some of our PhD's were presenting incorrect conclusions because of selective sampling.  I was laid off without a severance package, hell they still haven't sent my COBRA paperwork.","Having a Ph.D. doesn‚Äôt guarantee an honest individual, however, the opposite is also true. Those people were dishonest people, having a Ph.D. was irrelevant."
"The harsh reality people don't want to be told is that the people that get laid off aren't ""top performers"" or ""key assets"". Businesses don't cripple themselves and you can cry and downvote all you want, but that won't change reality. So yeah, slack off and get laid off, rinse and repeat if you want.","Exactly, OP‚Äôs mindset is EXACTLY what gets you fired or laid off. Self fulfilling prophecy."

Reading this I'm so glad I'm not in the US,The flip side is when people see US salaries they are jealous. There‚Äôs trade offs.

"Sometimes the recruiter just doesn't know. Candidates put ""SQL, Python, R, Tableau"" on their resume and the recruiter just says cool this person meets the check boxes. And the candidate is obviously going to tell a recruiter ""Yeah I know \_\_\_\_ pretty well.""

Then when you interview the candidate and ask them how good are they with SQL, they say ""Whoa whoa whoa there, I just wanna clarify, when I said I knew SQL, what I really meant is the data analyst I work with provides me the query and I just hit CTRL + ENTER""

This happens a lot with MBA grads/recruits where they list all this DS knowledge on their resume, but then when you ask them about it they immediately freak out and ""clarify"" that what they really meant was they used R Studio once in their homework in their business statistics class. Why are we interviewing MBAs in the first place? Cause we're not always hiring a DS. Sometimes we're hiring a Manager of Analytics who is expected to do some data wrangling/light scripting and ad hoc analysis, but we need that person to also have some business sense and do some strategy work (aka make pretty ass decks).","This is gratifying to hear. I wrapped my MBA and realized that my way into the industries I want was to understand data. I jumped in took every data class I could and tried everything I could like tableau and SPSS.

"I'm not a data scientist, but an SWE. Here's how I went from guy with a science degree to dev at Google:

1) Got semi-technical geoscience job out of college, showed my enjoyment of/proficiency towards programming there by requesting dev workloads  
2) Got hired as a dev at my next job because I told them I did a lot of dev work  
3) Did a few midsize-dev jobs in between  
4) Finally practiced my leetcodes and got into FAANG.

It was absolutely worth the grind. 

\---

Side note: I have a friend who is studying for a DS master's degree in Houston and he's not even studying SQL. Here's how you do data science in Houston:

1) Show SQL and reporting proficiency  
2) Try to learn fancier things and work them into your job  
3) Brag about them on your resume and work as a proper data scientist at your next gig

Some experienced DS people might have different ideas, but nearly every company these days need people talented at SQL. Once you learn to handle the data pipelines you can build from there.",What kind of geoscience job were you doing that required programming??
"This is very good! I'll add one additional Q/A:

DO I NEED TO BE GOOD WITH PEOPLE?

Yes! First, when you're applying, no one wants to work with a weirdo. You should be able to have a basic conversation with people, and they shouldn't come away from it thinking you'll follow them home and wear their skin as a suit. Once you get a job, you'll be interacting with colleagues, and you'll need them to care about your analysis. Presumably, there are non-technical people making decisions you'll need to bring in as well. If you can't explain to a moderately intelligent person why they should care about the thing that took you 3 days (and cost $$$ in cloud computing costs), you probably won't have your position for long. You don't need to be the life of the party, but you should be pleasant to be around.",This is fantastic and I'm adding it to the original post.

"great post. Will just share my experience as someone who made an early career pivot from non-science role to DS. FWIW, have always had relative ease (able to quickly learn) when it comes to technical / computer / math stuff, but ended up getting Urban Planning undergrad (not much technical / math required). 

Worked for a few years, started getting good at excel data analysis and GIS (ArcMap / QGIS etc.) on-the-job and decided I wanted to dive fully into DS.

Rather than pursue a CS or generic DS grad program, I found a program that intersected DS & Urban Planning (specifically titled ""Urban Informatics""). Program focused a bit on urban theory / etc. but mostly taught the technical (statistics, programming, database management, ML, etc.) and EVERY class project was oriented towards urban planning / smart city related ""problems"". Given I already had the subject matter background / passion, that lens motivated me and made it much more tangible when learning the technical concepts.

I graduated, got an entry-level DS job (also in the ""smart city"" space), promoted to Senior DS in <2 years, promoted to Product Manager <2 years after that.

It's totally doable, but DS roles are becoming more and more niche / diversified. **My advice would be to pick a particular niche / path and pursue that** (as opposed to saying ""I want to get into DS""... OK great, that could mean 1,000 different things)","This is super interesting. I've been thinking about pivoting to the urban planning field from marketing analytics, but have had trouble figuring out how. Can I ask what kind of work you do? Do you work directly with a city or is it with some kind of firm? Are there many roles available? What does your typical day look like?

Sorry for the barrage of questions but I had not heard of Urban infomatics despite my interest in urban planning going back years. I've only seen folks discuss in ArcGIS stuff so I never dug deeper."
"Great! Thanks for this.

All the low-effort posts about getting started in DS should be referred here. I am getting sick of half the posts on the sub being requests for basic information on the field that can be found in 30 seconds of Google searching.","Not in DS (followed this sub a few years ago because I thought I was going into this path, but pivoted to a different field), but I have the same frustration in the career subreddits for my field.

‚ÄúIdk how to get started, help‚Äù if you can‚Äôt figure out how to use Google to answer such a basic question, then you should quit while you‚Äôre ahead."

"Overall, love it.  I'm very wary of this one though:

> Mega bonus points here if you can figure out a way to attribute a dollar value to your contribution.

Most of the time I see dollar value attributions on a resume, it's a yellow flag to me.  It reeks of bullshit and a lack of understanding most of the time.","This is a very fair point. If you put dollar signs on any sort of resume then they should deservedly be questioned. My reasoning for including dollar (now that I think about this, I probably should have tried to be a bit more inclusive to our non-American friends - maybe monetary value would be a better term here?) signs as a because it shows me a candidate is thinking about the business value side of things in addition to the technical skills. That and it might help the resume make it past the first HR layer of scrutiny. Once they're in the interview process, grill 'em on the measurement specifics - you can tell pretty quickly who has no idea what they actually did."
"Unpopular opinion here from someone working in the field for many years, math isn‚Äôt as important as some aficionados report. Yes, and understanding of linear algebra and calculus can be useful, however, shipping products that deliver value is most important over everything else. 

Did you use some basic sklearn model that you don‚Äôt fully understand at the mathematical level, but generally understand it‚Äôs benefits/limitations/applicability? Does it deliver value to your company? AMAZING!

Did you write a report to your leader telling them why XYZ may not theoretically work because of a lemma that you leaned in uni and you can solve differential equations to show it? Cool? Really need to think about if this delivers value or not. Oh sure, maybe you can prevent investment in an area that‚Äôs doomed to failure, but realistically 99% of the time your time would be beater spent putting the math texts down and delivering data products.

EDIT: I should note that this was a really great summary and advice OP. Thanks for your contribution.","Yup. As someone with a very strong math background I find that it is pretty rarely used on the job. Of course it‚Äôs hard to argue that you *don‚Äôt* need something.

"Great guide. One point I may add is that if you don't have a comp sci / mathematical degree or industry experience then don't waste your time applying for data science jobs. Instead, look for something else data-related, e.g. data analyst, business intelligence analyst, etc. You will of course need to supplement what you learn on the job outside of work to become a data scientist, but don't be the muppet applying to jobs you don't have a cat's chance in hell of getting - be realistic and realise getting the role you want isn't necessarily a linear process","I don't have a comp sci or math degree. Not everyone needs one of those to get into data science - it's just a harder road.

"> be familiar with linear algebra and learn what the hell a partial derivative is. 

Why? I‚Äôve never once used either of those in my job.

All my professors told me LA was the way to go. God I wish I‚Äôd ignored them. Linear Algebra wasn‚Äôt used one time, it was all calculus based.","edit: What they neglected to explain is that they don't have a stats graduate degree, they have a political science degree. 

This is mind-blowing to me. Not in a stats graduate program, but my undergrad was in math and I took a couple of stats grad courses to supplement my compsci masters and it was full of linear algebra. In my compsci program, I'd say linear algebra has been crucial in almost all the courses I've taken, with the exception being the required ""fundamental"" courses like algorithms etc. 

This is honestly concerning, are you saying that this was for a statistics MS, or these were stats courses you took for a different program? I don't believe that any accredited stats program could possibly skip this because the implication is that you skipped the normal equation--which is one of the very first things you should learn.

[deleted],"If you want to get better at programming, and IMO if you want to be a good DS you must do, you should code every single day. As hard as you can, as much as you can. At least that's what I had to to in my case (coming from economics) to get a decent technical level and land a DS job. I know it's hard but you get better at it with time. Just practice everyday (or every 2 days, but better if you do it everyday). After 1 year of programing almost every day, you might (I do) start to feel that you're getting a solid understanding of what's going on. But besides that, there is no shortcut. And if there is, it's probably a bad idea to take it. Don't trust those ""become a DS in 2  weeks"" or ""learn python in 6h"" stuff. That does not exist. 

Oh and by the way, just because coding is important, it doesn't mean it is all. Remember you have to know ML, stats, maths and have communication skills, among all the stuff mentioned in this post.

Forgot to include big o style algorithmic logic, sql problem solving and live coding, probability questions and differentiation, deep learning.
Don‚Äôt forget these roles also pay about 40-90k.

DM me for the questions",Jesus why
Where is this job located if you don‚Äôt mind me asking. Think I‚Äôm getting very underpaid as an associate data scientist with six months of experience and a master‚Äôs degree. Good luck on the next round!,"Washington, D.C."
"Question: I write SQL queries pretty frequently for my job, but I would probably struggle to answer almost all the questions on the SQL section. I guess my knowledge of SQL doesn't extend past functionality. Should I go out and study SQL specifically, or were the interviewers on this job just oddly stringent on SQL questions for some reason?","All of my interviews for SQL have been very basic. I have had coding challenges that all involved WHERE, CASE STATEMENTS, HAVING, GROUP BY, INNER/LEFT JOINS, and a few that had sub-queries."
‚Ä¶. And now here are the excel files you‚Äôll be actually working with. Update them manually every Monday with the file from sally and send them to Bill.,And that's when I'll use Python to just automate my job and never let anyone know ;)
"Whenever I see salaries like that I wonder why I‚Äôve settled for my pay, lol.

Congrats on everything!",Thank you so much!
Bro what these are like the questions I was asked as a data analyst üò´üò´,"Data Science = Data Analytics now haha! Companies don't know how to differentiate the two, but will pay you DS pay for DA. Use this knowledge and go make the big bucks :P"
"Is this your first job? Btw how long has it been since you have been working with Python, SQL, etc.?",I have been in a Data Analytics role for 3 years and been working with those applications about that time. Nothing terribly complex.
Seems like a good set of questions for this level role. Good luck!,All it‚Äôs missing is the harmonic mean deep dive!
CongratsÔºÅNo machine learning questions at all in the interview?,"Nope! It's a Data Science job with emphasis on more data visualization, cleaning, and manipulation. Data Analytics I suppose."
"Honest question? Are these easy or normal questions? 

I feel like I could answer those without even studying computer science. And the pay is very high.","These are quite easy, and there's no way I could answer advanced ""Data Science"" questions like you see people posting here. I know basic statistics/probability, descriptive statistics, and elementary math in general.

The main part is being able to relate it to the job. How could I use STDEV to explain 'x', or what data could I pull to explain 'y'? I provided an example on most of these questions that was clear, concise, and met (I hope) the business need for them."
Wow nice. Thanks for sharing. Good luck!,You're welcome!
"Tableau - ""What is the difference between a live view and extract? When would you use each?""

Fuckers making dashboards with datasets of 50M rows on a live connection.",Hahahahaha
"Something something chickens before they hatch, but good luck regardless.","Yeah, probably. But I did want to share questions I was asked for others who may be interested. Like I said, even if I don't get the job I am proud of how well I handled each question."
After this post at least one MSc of Applied Statistics with +10 years of experience in data/analytics position getting \~40% of those money in Eastern Europe will start looking for remote opportunities...,"I encourage you to but OP said this job was in DC and I don‚Äôt think I read it‚Äôs remote. DC is like top 5 cities for cost of living thus local salaries typically reflect that, even for lower experience jobs

Average rent is like 2.5k or something"
Great post!,Thank you!
"Congratulations!
Good luck on your journey",Thank you for your kindness.
"I‚Äôm sooo confused. I can answer these questions but I‚Äôm exclusively applying to Data Analyst positions. This is essentially what I thought people said I should be expecting for an interview. Especially the SQL portion. I feel like I‚Äôm going to end up lowballing myself hard in Cali.

Is this a tech company?

Also congrats!!","Most data science roles are just data analytics roles including FANG.

The fact is most companies data infrastructure is ready for actual data science work or in FANG‚Äôs case they let the PhD folks do it."
"Hi OP, congrats!! Would you mind telling which company was this?","Hi! I cannot, unfortunately. Especially because I don't really even have the job yet. It's not any sort of FAANG company or startup, however. It's a Healthcare organization."
Thank you for sharing!,You're welcome!
Thank you for sharing.,You're welcome!
Any live coding questions?,"Surprisingly, no. Maybe the 3rd round will - not sure, but all my other interviews at other companies did have live and take-home SQL/Python coding questions."
"Seems like mostly softballs, no offense",I don't take offense to that. I'll take softballs and an easy going job for 120k any day.
"How do I save this? OP thank you so much, very informative!","Glad it could be helpful! Bookmark it, or just in case it gets deleted, just copy and paste it into a document :)!"
Don‚Äôt seem like too bad of questions and I‚Äôm about to receive a raise for half of that salary but then again you‚Äôre in DC. Good luck with it üëç,Thanks my friend!
"Answers from my experience (and probably why I can‚Äôt find better work):

* view - clever hack when your org is stuck in 2002 using SSRS and MS Report Builder to make datasets. Also a good alternative to CTE when nested in other views when MS SSMS cocks up the syntax because it‚Äôs auto linting sucks.

* table dynamism - it could be dynamic, it could be static. I‚Äôve definitely had a nonCS background staff member ask me how to dynamically change table column names and dynamically update them. He found a stack overflow example that could‚Äôve worked in theory. Just because you can doesn‚Äôt mean you should.

* primary vs foreign - self explanatory

* inner vs left - inner covers 80% of cases, left is for when it doesn‚Äôt.

* where vs having - 99% of the time where is sufficient.

* I hate subqueries. Too many nonCS people nesting them 35 subqueries deep and then asking me to debug because it doesn‚Äôt work. Just use CTEs and then refactor those out to views.

* slow queries - 99% of the time it‚Äôs either my employers slow ass VPN or their slow ass virtualized SQL server.

* Python libraries - too many, but pandas for data frames and file reading into data frames, and numpy for some other stuff. os because it‚Äôs useful. SQLAlchemy because I hate stored procedures for no reason. Scikit learn because duh.

* honestly don‚Äôt know off the top of my head but I‚Äôd try just wrapping with max(), then .max(), then np.max(), then stack overflow.

* functions - callable reusable code that does a thing.

* for vs while - for will end in theory, but not always when cocked up by some nonCS accounting clerk playing at knowing technology who decided to reassign the loop variable value each iteration. Definitely seen this one take down core banking mainframe when there was a file create line in the iteration too - yes your money is managed by systems this unstable.

* cleaning data is a process too lengthy to explain in an interview.","These arent answers to the questions, youre just rambling"

"Yes budgets are usually finalized in November and December. 

The best time to look for work is Q1 of any year.",Exactly. We‚Äôve known for a couple months that as soon as 2025 hit we were going to have the budget to hire a couple more people.
Congrats!! Can I ask what is your experience level?,"I‚Äôm a director at one of the largest financial companies. Not a people leader, it‚Äôs just a job grade. I do have two masters and a few certs including AWS. I‚Äôll admit that my resume looks good on paper but the biggest challenge was getting someone to look at it."
"It felt like this week surpassed all of 2023 for me.

Prior to ""2020"" I don't recall such hiring floods in January.  Seems maybe people adjusted to a new normal? But also, hiring froze last year in March/April and then June, and the bottom fell out in August until December.  So, we'll see how this year progresses.

Companies usually hire in June so they can launch in fall, and they'll hire in March/April so they can launch in summer.  So there's another month and a half of opportunities after February until the summer lull.  But then after September, it's a downhill slip during the last quarter.  By October budgets are frozen solid for the next 6 months unless urgent.

How did people job hunt prior to July 2008?  I don't know of any January flood hiring prior to that time.  It's both a new and old hiring strategy.

What I would tell younger people is that there used to be Dec-17 to Feb-1 shut downs for wage work.  Companies usually started recruiting a month and a half ""after"" the holidays, and sometimes posting ads would pick up dramatically in March/April.  You also never knew how many people left jobs in December or got promoted in January, which opened up opportunities by March/April. But the ""official"" once a year hiring was definitely in the summer. Sometimes companies would hire in the fall for a ""holiday"" campaign for retail customers but that's not like January hiring now, which is a very recent thing.

Basically job agencies adjusted to the behavior of unemployment lines stretching around the corner in January or something, but nowhere did such a large amount of people search for jobs as in the past 6 years, or take time off to search for jobs as in the last 20 years.  So in some way things have changed profoundly. Not sure what.","Yeah, feb-april is best time for job hopping generally in a technical field. Annual budgets and headcount get approved and managers can finally open the role they've needed for the past 9 months."
can you be a bit more specific where you are looking for jobs ? and seniority level  ?,I used LinkedIn to find the jobs which directed me to the companies career pages. I then look at the career pages for any roles that matched my experience. I was looking for more senior level roles. I ended up getting a FAANG offer
My company is looking for 2 seasoned Data Scientist. PM me for more info.,Appreciate it
Even for entry level positions?,Sorry I don‚Äôt know about entry positions. But my recommendation for anyone having a hard time breaking into data is to take on an entry level position like a call center in a large company. Even better if they will pay you to get licensed (ie FINRA or insurance licenses). There‚Äôs usually mobility after a few years and you can pivot internally. Professional maturity is something most recent grads lack plus industry domain knowledge are important for analytics. I worked 8 years as a phone rep and did cold calling sales before I pivoted to analytics. This new career path has done extremely well for me and I really credit my sales experience for that
I'm junior level and have three interviews in this week and 1 next week. That's more than 7 months of 2024,"Hey

Hopefully the response rate will be better...","2023 summer was VERY rough ‚Äì someone close to me, whose an absolute killer, took \~6 months to find a tech job even though in 2022 they got 3 offers within 1 month (all for similar comp as what they got in 2023). 2025 should be easier!"
I am thinking of switching my career from mechanical engineering to data science. But I aint that sure whether its a good decision. It seems like that there are a lot of job opportunities in this field in Germany. Do I have a chance of  starting this career path as a fresh starter?,"Depends how many YOE you have.

"Sorry, Im gonna ask a few questions - 
 - how many years of experience do you have?
- are you based in Europe?
- how is the salary?
- can a 2 years experience one apply for FAAANG? How is the probability of getting hired?","I have 16 years of professional experience. 8 in data. 

I am US

My old job was 250k plus remote work. I was hired in 2022 when companies were paying like crazy. I had to leave since they are making everyone go into the office and I didn‚Äôt want to relocate for this employer. New job is the same salary and I do have to relocate but it‚Äôs worth the experience for me with this new employer. But just to be clear, in my 2nd year of working professionally, I made 32k in a call center. Don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre behind 

I can‚Äôt speak for less experienced job seekers but my impression is that unless you‚Äôre the top 1% of your peers with exceptional projects, I don‚Äôt think FAANG will consider you. I personally know little Python but I‚Äôm an expert in SQL, tableau, and Adobe analytics. I have experience with a few other tools as well from my interest in learning more. But for this new job, they hired me because of my relationship management and program management skills.

Should I stop listing SAS on my resumes? Lol,SAS is like Oracle SQL. Not hip and trendy but entrenched market share in a lot of big corporations. It's a lot better than no experience and there will likely be companies using SAS for decades to come so nothing to really worry about.

This makes feel good after a day jumping back and forth between python and SAS because I cannot use sql.,???? I'm sorry what
Do you think banks will move away from SAS to open sources ?,"Yes I believe so.  Some bigger banks have switched a majority of their stuff from SAS to Python or R.  Mid sized banks typically will now allow you to build models in open source rather than dictating it has to be in SAS.  I believe there has been guidance from federal regulators (in one of their SR letters) that says using open source is ok.  So I think it is a matter of time before they move to open source.  One other thing to consider-with more banks developing their mobile apps and payment apps like Zelle, Venmo, etc., they will want to switch to open source for better compatibility."
The best DS is SPSS because it's drop downs ensure maximum scalability.,I use SPSS for some large datasets.  It works for me but gets no love.  I think it will die soon.
What‚Äôs wrong with SAS? Why don‚Äôt people like it?,"It‚Äôs closed source with licensing fees and an ancient syntax. That said, people have used it for rock solid production-level data analysis pipelines that can be and have been maintained for decades (particularly in the heavily-regulated fields of banking and healthcare)."
Julia?,"I started reading on Julia. It looks realllyyyyyyy good. You can even write python directly in your notebooks with a simple @ macro. It's crazy. And Tensorflow.jl wrapper is arguably better than Python's Tensorflow.   


And the native matrix typing/operations makes it so fast. I'm definetely learning it in the next few months"

"As much as I love Python and R, SAS is a must for fields like clinical trials.","R and python can run linreg too... 
When you say ‚Äúmust‚Äù you mean that academia is slow to move which isn‚Äôt exactly the definition of must."
"What R/Python functionality can be used for dataset handling and merging across systems?

I grew up on SAS but want to move to Python/R (and the company supports the transition because $).  Most use cases for SAS are not statistical but just data handling across systems.  Creating new views/etc is impossible to get tech to prioritize or business to fund, so analytics teams are always creating large (~20M row, ~100 column) datasets to look at specific parts of the business differently.  SAS handles this nicely with their dataset (*.sas7bdat) functionality.  

What is an equivilent way to create long term datasets via python/R?  Must they reside on a sql server/specialized server, or can the files sit in a simple network path with other files?

thanks.",This is trivial. Persisting data as files on HDFS has been a thing for years. Look into parquet if you'd like to know more.

"I read it in Philomena Cunk's voice, it is perfect",Someone deepfake that
Number 5 definitely made me do a spittake,"Yes, I caused said breach ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù and blamed the company‚Äôs lack of code review, source control, data governance, transparency in reporting, business user request driven SWE tooling adoption (think sales teams deciding what SWE use to work), overly generous privileges granted to SWE because they expected them to also do all forms of IT support, application user support, vendor liaison work, end user workflow supervision and overrides (think bank teller not allowed to make a $100,000 wire so they call IT who sends them to SWE who somehow have the privilege set to do this because the teller line managers don‚Äôt have this access nor the knowledge, so SWE make the overrides and approve the wire). 

Think an entire company blindly relying on SWE team for everything because the operations lead made an internal career change to SWE 20 years ago, but also was the only person left after two decades of managing people out who knew how anything was done there. They took all the privileges of their old role and the new one so production wouldn‚Äôt stop. Over time the SWE team expanded and each new hire inherited that same overly expansive privilege set.

Literally all this privilege assignment was overlooked because they managed out the previous CTO and were then unable to find another because the previous executive team got the company sued for labor law violations by its entire previous IT department (with the exception of that one legacy SWE/operations lead) and no one wants to fill those shoes.

"1. It's Microsoft Excel simply because it's the only ""launguage"" I've been allowed to use in the corporate environment, despite suggesting that granting me SQL priveleges and access to various project-related databases would have been a more effective and productive means of completing the automation of the complex report I was responsible for producing, analyzing, and presenting to stakeholders highlighting the largest opportunities within their team/line of business. Second favorite language for data analytics purposes aside from Excel would be Python.

2. No, I have yet to work with a machine learning algorithm.

3. To ensure the accuracy of data I always make sure the data comes from the official repository and that it is as up-to-date as the system allows, ie. that either the automated process that pushed the data to the system or aggregator I use is functioning properly and timely or the team that manually suppllies the datasets has done so per the agreed upon terms. Upon receiving the data, I look for any outliers that may hint at loss of data integrity and compare the data set to historical data to make sure the expected trend is being followed. If there are any outliers, I do research on the systems/processes producing the data to determine whether there was some sort of adhoc event that triggered the fluctuation or if the data was indeed corrupted somehow. 

4. Correlation would be when there are two different trends or stories being told by the data that are related to one another in either a negative, positive or neutral way consistently. Causation is when one event is the actor and there is another event that triggers as a result and is completely dependent upon the first event. In the instance of causation the second event could occur on its own without the actor as described in the example actually triggering the event because they're not necessarily correlated 100% of the time. That's the best way I can think of the difference, although in many instances the two terms could very well be interchangeable.

5. I've never experienced a data breach professionally, but I wouldn't cover it up were I to experience one as that is not in compliance with any reputable firm's cyber security policy as it could expose the firm (or other firms business is being conducted with) to unnecessary risk and damage its reputation, incur costs in the way of either fines or expenses addressing the gaps in the infrastructure or security measures taken to ensure data remains secure. Additionally, it's immoral not to report a breach as it could expose clients, either internal or external, to risk themselvese.

6. Data privacy is ensured through the use of Identity and Access Management measures, appropriate fcyber security policies, encryption where appropriate, and effective training for all employees given access to information considered Confidential, Private, Secret, Top Secret, Special Access, etc. based on the type of organization retaining the data.  n 

7. I am honestly not familiar with then concept of overfitting data. 

8. I handle missing data values differently depending on the reason for its absence. If it looks as though there's an error because of a flaw in the system I raise the issue with the technology team responsible for fixing breaks. If it's a breach of data I would raise the issue with cyber security. If the missing data is literally just blank or null values it more than likely is supposed to be that way and means something specific, so I would look up the data dictionary and determine what it means.

9. The best example I can think of in reference to imbalanced data would be when two different repositories are keeping track of largely fhe same entities (operating systems or servers in this case) but are possibly not registering the same number of systems because the method of allocating a server to one line of business over another might vary per system or repository. One system could label an org as having ownership of the asset itself for instance, where another might view the owner of the primary application on the asset as also owning the server.

10. Some examples of supervised learning would be formally learning an agreed upon curriculum either through enrolling in courses at a university, certificate program, or other schooling or possibly through a training program at you work. Unsupervised learning is material that you teach yourself, usually in isolation, but could also be done in a group setting if everyone was researching and trialing/erroring the information in an attempt to learn what they deem to be important about the topic for their purposes and in an order such that it would allow them to digest all of the remaining information on the topic as needed, once their baseline understanding of the topic was solidified. They're not the same thing and what works best for one person may not be best for another.",Jesus Christ you remind me of me exactly 3 years ago.
Job hunt results as a mid-level Data Scientist w/ ADHD,[deleted]
[deleted],It‚Äôs because they want unicorns. Happens in tech. ‚ÄúWe just lost 4 people so we need to hire one person who can do all 4 things as replacement!‚Äù
How many years of experience do you have?,5
[deleted],I think so! Product is obviously different but problem space is similar.
Oof do you disclose? I just had a falling out with former boss...,I'm not sure about this and it's something I have to talk to my therapist and poll others about. It might have helped but I've had so many managers at this job that means I would've had to disclose to each one...
üòÇ was planning on making a visualization with my job apps too. I'm at 200 so far...,I was waiting until 200 for mine but the holiday season has been such a dead end in the search I‚Äôm pausing until mid January.
"I am at the point where I don't even have an idea about how many I have applied for but a guess would be 400-500 lol.
50ish interview calls, my interviews go well but always get choked up with emails ""You did great but we took someone with more closer experience than you"" üíÄ.
I have 5 years of experience btw. (DA, DE roles, I am not a ds)","I'm sorry, it sucks out there :("
"Most of the time, no response or resume rejected are due to that one keyword was missing, that HR thinks is necessary.

It doesn't matter if someone can do all around that skillset, but if that keyword is missing, very less chances are that resume will get shortlist.",Recruiters not understanding what the DS team is looking for is a big issue.  I was hiring for a DS role once and looked at a bunch of the resumes that were rejected and was like wtf.

"Out of curiosity, did you apply exclusively to Data Scientist positions or was it a mixture of titles?",Mostly D's and some machine learning engineer positions.
What were the application channels that she used? Did you apply directly on the company website? Were there any referrals?

Basically everyday is one of those perfect flow days where I can get into deep work for multiple sessions, days which were so rare before. I also take large doses of fish oil as well.","There is no good evidence to support huperzine-A being a suitable treatment for ADHD. As such a psychiatrist isn't going to prescribe it.

That doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't work, but when suggesting un-proven treatment options (whether natural medicine, OTC, or microdosing shrooms) you should never present it as if it was a fact supported by evidence when it isnt"
"In the 'wrong role, etc' section, were those jobs you turned down or ones where they told you they didn't think it was the right role for you? Also, what's WLB?","Ones I specifically turned down. WLB means work life balance.  I have little kids so I prioritize not having to work late at night, avoid taking meetings during bedtime and refuse to touch my computer during the weekend."
I had more or less the identical experience. One offer after 80+ applications. Last year however I had around 12 applications and 3 offers. So I do think it is more the market situation we are in at the moment,I think so too. Before I started applying I compiled a list of friends and former coworkers I could use as referrals. I think all but one company went under hiring freezes and layoffs in the next two months.

How many of those have you read? Which would you say are the top 3 most useful/insightful to you in your career so far?,"I would say I've read about half of them, but I've played with the others a little.

The most usefull?

Number one would be a tie between *'A Pragmatic Programmer'* and *'Clean Code'* by Andrew Hunt, David Thomas, and Martin C Martin respectfully. They both focus on good habits to develop as a developer. Things like variable naming, proper exception handling, when and how to comment. Things like that you cant learn in a programming course.

&#x200B;

Although these are not needed for my current job, I plan on pursing a Masters in Data Analytics, so  Number 2 would be *ORIELLY 'Data Science Handbook by 'Jake Vanderclass', 'SPRINGER An Introduction to Statistical Learning', and Hands on Machine Learning with Sci-Kit Learn and Tensorflow' - Aurelien Geron.* I'm very interested in Data Science, and plan on getting my masters on  Data Analyse. The Data Science Handbook in particular I use almost once a day, it has everything you need to know for pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. 

&#x200B;

   Last, '*Test Driven Development with python' by Harry J.W. Percival*. This one I've gotten halfway through for really no reason didn't finish it. Not only does it teach you how to develop using Test Driven Development, but is also a great tutorial for web app development using python and django."

In other fields people usually brag with their book collection and want to see each other's collections, but in computer science you get mocked for buying the books because you could have pirated them or downloaded the 1997 edition or whatever.

I wanted to buy a book that teaches something about logic circuits. The book was heavy, and it was filled with numbers and symbols. At that moment, I knew that this field is isn't for me. So, I didn't buy the book.

Dear book readers, how do you read books? Do you read everything from cover to cover? Or, you use the table of content to read a specific topic? Or, how? 

Please share your method, and your goals when you read lots of books.","Depends 100% on the book and the subject.

Additionally, if the book isn‚Äôt 100% directly related to something I need to know, I‚Äôll skim past the irrelevant parts.

If the book is something related to my field or a subject I am deeply interested in, I‚Äôll read the whole book. 

Also, if you don‚Äôt find a book is serving you, quit reading it. For example, after the first few chapters I dropped clean code because I felt it was losing its value. No regrets on that."

Nice! Now do back propagation,"Lol... best explanation I've found: https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/

Also, follow it exactly step by step. Write out ALL of the expressions on a pad of paper and make sure you understand each term. Try to calculate some of the values by hand and check your answers with the author's work. Overall, go slow."
"That's a great analogy, have you got one for the F1-Score? The calculation/meaning of that one always slips my mind",Yea something something harmonica
"Thought it might be helpful to those learning to spell out the analogy:

||Predicted Negative (in lake)|Predicted Positive (in net)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Actual Negative (rocks)|True Negative (rocks not caught)|False Positive (rocks caught)|
|Actual Positive (fish)|False Negative (fish not caught)|True Positive (fish caught)|

Recall = True Positive / (True Positive + False Negative)

\--> Recall = fish caught / (fish caught + fish not caught)

Precision = True Positive / (True Positive + False Positive)

\--> Precision = fish caught / (fish caught + rocks caught)",There you go ruined it for the Non DS people. The original post is made of gold.
"Haha, I've used an analogy about fish in a lake to describe ROC AUC and ranking. But I basically said imagine a lake is full of fish and trash cans, and you just have one net. The ML is basically like switching a magnet on on one end of the lake, drawing the trash cans towards it and leaving most of the fish at the other end. The better the ROC AUC score, the stronger the magnet.

I didn't know fish in lakes were such a common DS trope.",But how is this related to ranking?
I like this. Can you explain the significance of the smaller net and targeted spot on the lake? Not following this. I see it‚Äôs another example but I don‚Äôt follow why it‚Äôs mentioned and why it‚Äôs relative to the first net example. Thanks.,"A few ways of looking at the smaller net & pocket:

1. A subset of the data might have different performance. Let's say your model is predicting something about people who live in a certain US state. It may have good performance in certain cities, bad performance in others.
2. To extend the 2d spatial metaphor, a model is a discriminator that generates solution boundaries in a space. The boundary separates positives and negatives. The closer you can fit your model to the boundaries of the solution space, the better it performs. Having a tight net matching a smaller area with concentrated fish works better intuitively. Ideally, you have an adjustable net and high resolution mapping of the lake showing exactly where the fish (and rocks) are. The ""high resolution mapping"" could equate to more data rows, allowing your solution boundaries (net size and shape) to be intricate (as generated by the ML model), perfectly capturing the fish and avoiding the rocks."
[deleted],"Accuracy would be the total correct classifications out of the total observations. I believe in this case, that would mean the number of fish in the net and the number of rocks remaining in the lake after the net is pulled in divided by the total number of fish and rocks. 

We don't know how many rocks are in the lake but lets pretend it's 500. That would give us 80 fish caught (true positives) and 420 rocks not captured (true negatives) out of 100 fish and 500 rocks.

(80 + 420) / (100 + 500) = 83% accuracy

This is good example of why precision and recall don't give you the full picture. If there were only 80 rocks in the lake total, you would still have 80% recall and 50% precision. The logical conclusion is that your net is good at catching fish but not so good at avoiding rocks. What you wouldn‚Äôt know is that your net is insanely adept at picking up rocks and you‚Äôd be better if marketing it as a rock removal tool than a fishing net. 

They're fine metrics when your positives and negatives are both well represented but for heavily imbalanced datasets, they can paint a misleading picture."
Data scientist quits her job at Spotify,You can‚Äôt manage a pushy stakeholder unless your boss supports you.
You can‚Äôt manage a pushy stakeholder unless your boss supports you.,"Yep, every employee should understand the value of the word ‚Äúcapacity‚Äù. Managers should know who‚Äôs at capacity and should filter requests so that only top priority requests get worked on.

40 hours a week of hard work is my max capacity. If I‚Äôm working at max capacity and you come to me with more work, I‚Äôm going to ask my manager if it‚Äôs higher priority than what is currently putting me at max capacity. If it‚Äôs not higher priority, it‚Äôll get documented for future work and put into my backlog."
"> How do you manage a ‚Äúpushy‚Äù stakeholder?

I'm a SWE, not a data scientist, but my answer for a case like this is quite simple.

Me: ""I'm struggling to meet the demands here. My understanding is that this is a very important and high priority initiative, is that right?""

Stakeholder: ""Yes, it's very high priority and urgent.""

Me: ""So why am I the only person who's working on it? Can we get more resources?""

Then the stakeholder is forced to either backtrack and admit that the urgency and priority isn't as high as they're making it out to be, or else is forced up the chain of command to provide additional resources.

If this seems confrontational, _it is_. If you work at a place where you feel afraid to have a direct conversation like this, you need to get out regardless.","Yeah unfortunately for me my personality is I‚Äôm *too* confrontational. Frankly I need to watch my tone half the time so I‚Äôm actually worried I‚Äôm gonna say something with a slight flare to it and piss them off, like I‚Äôd say something like ‚Äúit will get done when it gets done‚Äù which is definitely bad but like they legit don‚Äôt have the right to push us"
"This is not uncommon, especially for data scientists embedded into non-data teams as she was. Ultimately, stakeholders dont understand the time silent work takes (interpreting requirements, sourcing or even extracting data, due dilligence in data interpretation, data processing, storytelling, generating visualizations) as its outside their domain and have their own prios/deadlines to worry about. Tbf, I‚Äôm a DS and cant even properly estimate how long a request will take unless using data I produced or am super familiar with.¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬†¬†

Add on top, managing changing requirements and the enormous level of context switching between trying to do deep work and sporading meetings in all levels of the org (your immediate stakeholders, your team, company-wide, etc) and Slack messages.¬†So, data scientists are asked for work beyond the time or mental bandwidth they have.¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†

The DS role can be VERY ambiguous and unstructured (even in good companies like Spotify), stories like this are the unfortunate consequence. I‚Äôm personally preparing myself to transition to slightly more structured job types within tech because each of my DS roles is completely different from the next, including in the tasks I do or the knowledge I‚Äôm expected to have.",[deleted]
"Extremely common.


Company - says they support work/life balance.


Gives work that takes 14 hours while claiming it takes 7.


Struggle and go to manager - instant performance issues.


Suffer in silence - company gets what they want, cheap labour.


Suffer in volume - manager repeats work/life balance mantra but says work still needs doing, so useless, see struggle and go to manager.


They build it into the system so everyone who has bills panics and just ""gets on with it"".


It is purposeful, they know they are doing it.¬†


They then sell the ""we're a top 5 company, of course its hard and we work hard"" and gaslight everyone at how they're a big name and so you are a shit hot employee and love to circlejerk.


Highly productive and high intellect people seem to occupy the same people who don't like saying no, people please and overanalyse and think maybe they are performing badly and thats why it takes 14 hours every 7 hour day (they aren't performing badly).

"I've been on some teams that have allowed DS to spend 6mo to a year churning out nothing of use. My experience on those teams was at mid-growth-stage startups in zero-interest era. IMO, a lot of those DS were not ever necessary, and yeah, a lot have gotten laid off in the past years, but the ones with a little more vision left on their own before that.

I'm not on data teams anymore but the DS team I work with now is small but managed well. They have a lot of backlog but the top is prioritized according to what needs to get done. A lot of us who are still working in tech rn are probably working a little harder, but still, managers should manage expectations / priorities / politics in a way to not have people working 10-12 hours for months. She also mentions she has a very strong identity tied to her job and she's young and doesn't know better -- that probably made this worse.

If you think of the current macroenvironment coupled with the fact that Spotify has generally not been profitable, even in zero interest times, then. yeah. maybe not the best place. Anyway, she's very privileged, has a good resume item that also helped her build her youtube (nice side money potentially). She'll be fine. You'll be fine.","I've seen this same thing too: entire DS org just off on their own building a labs type product with no idea how to square the circle and build something we can bring to an end user.  


This was at a start up with a lot of problems, but it just killed me that we were struggling to do some very basic product things, like consistently delivering a valuable product, and here was a team burning millions per year without any idea how what they were doing was going to contribute.  


Prioritization for these projects is just so hard to get right. Maybe it's the interface between technical and non-technical stakeholders, but I also think there's a fair bit of ""if we could only do X, that's what the customer wants"" without properly prioritizing that work within the context of what can be done at the current resource levels."

My manager was pretty much AFK and he didn't even know what projects we were working on unless I told him - so no support at all.

Anyway, I quit back in sept.  got a new job now in an unrelated field, but it's giving me time to pursue a new degree!  And I like my new job, manager, team, etc.  And I like where my life is going.   Oh yeah and it's a 100k pay cut.  But whatever, wife and I are fine financially.

"My thoughts;

1) Weird video, especially the beginning and when she laughed while giving her resignation.

2) Lead data scientist, sole data scientist, highest priority project.. that‚Äôs a senior position or higher, not L2. She should have had a lead on the project with her, or rapid advancement commensurate with those responsibilities. That‚Äôs an organizational failure. Healthy grain of salt, it‚Äôs likely she means a highest priority project local to her department, not at Spotify.

3) Seeking a new job was the right choice, though I would not have quit.  I think it would have been better to scale back her hours to ~6 / day while job hunting. Ride the paychecks while interviewing, until she found a new role or was fired.","Point 3:  If the girl was working 14 hrs/day, where does she find time to hunt/interview new jobs?  You can try to take sick leaves and PTO's but in this market, you'll need to interview 7-10 companies in order to get 1-2 offers given that you're talented."
Agree to it. Most of the work we do no matter how long per day is useless. We have overpaid bull shit jobs. I haven‚Äôt seen a nurse or surgeon crying and whining here.

"Why do people work such long hours? Just don't. You'd be surprised how supportive bosses are of the idea of you saying ""nah I'm not working OT else I'm going to burn out""","Mostly because they are afraid to lose their job. Whenever there's a human behaviour that doesn't make rational sense, then the reason likely is not a rational one.

Then you can look at the emotional and systemic reasons:

* have to support a family and work in an environment where you can get fired because someone got offended by the wrong joke?¬†
* no one ever taught you how to say ""no"" in a constructive way or how to set boundaries? That creates uncertainty. Rational behaviour in humans and uncertainty aren't the best mix.¬†
* or you actually know how to say ""no"" but you've had the wrong people in your life who get super offended by a reasonable request because it inconveniences them momentarily? Your behaviour kinda adapts because no matter how strong you are as an individual, you're not in a vacuum and subject to the community of people around you.

Also, it's a question of perception. If everyone does overtime and you don't see anyone speak up against it, then in your perception, everyone does it and for all intents and purposes this is what ""normal"" is.

If these above points don't apply to you, then congratulations, you either have had stellar individuals in your life or you were¬†very lucky with how your own personality turned out. üß°"
"If you look her up, she works in a dead end marketing feature. She seems to not understand that you don't get paid for the hours you put in, but the value you create. She may be a good ds, but she wasn't using it productively - that is the company's fault. 

But she was soft fired. There's some clear cognitive dissonance where she thinks she's working on spotify's most important project, yet she's the only one?

"Hm, there are things one can do on their end like
* optimisation of time management - sometimes we can do more by doing less (spending more time in the initial phase when you translate the stakeholder question to a data problem might do wonders)

* bargaining (e.g ""I can give you A and B now but C will have to wait as it's high effort low reward"", ""What is the minumum you need to enabled?"")

If that's all done and the workload is still too high for an extended period (work sometimes comes in waves) then I'd bring it up with the manager as more help is required in a constant level.

You grow a backbone and only work the hours you are obligated to.

More money doesn't stop burnout buddy!  Just document the work load and sue the damn company if they fire her.  Don't know why she had to quit first.
"The only way to prevent this type of situation is to be very clear when you join - and any time that someone asks you work more than 8 hours in a day - that you do not have bandwidth outside of work hours.  

The problem is that, if this is something that changed while you were already employed (i.e., new boss/new project that starts demanding >8 hours a day), then any attempt to protect your personal time could get you fired, PIPed, laid off, etc. 

I think it's one thing when a group *accidentally* overloads a person - i.e., that person doesn't know how to say no, and they end up taking on more that they can handle.

"First thing to say in the interview. 

‚Äú thanks for having me. I must say I am a little confused though. The job advertisement said graduate role but then it says 2-5 years required, which means you‚Äôre looking for a mid-level developer. Which is it?‚Äù",failing the interview like a total chad üòé
"> Well you see it's technically possible to...

Now we're implicitly requiring a very specific previous life trajectory?","In acedemia, these sorts of descriptions are often written when you already know who you want to hire. There might be a person who took a break after masters, worked 2 years industry, came back for a phd, and hasn't finished yet, and now you want him/her.

So you write 2 years industry expereince, masters/graduate student, entry level.

&#x200B;

One that I remember. Experience with <specific software for doing stellar modeling> combined with observational experience in galaxies, <super specific project on black holes>, no more than 5 years since PhD, at least PhD, candidates with experience favored, able to relocate to <location>. The topic combinations, PhD years requirement, experience being important, basically leave 1 person on Earth with the right qualifications. Even if there was a new PhD that had used the modelling software and done galaxy observations, they wouldn't have also done black hole observations, and if someone had done all of that, they were likely already 5 years out of PhD, and the person the job was written for had a previous post-doc, so would beat any fresh PhD. It's just BS."
"I don't think anyone would hire for an entry level machine learning role, I mean there can't be an entry level role for this skill. Unless ofcourse it's an internship program.",If you have a PhD in machine learning then they would hire entry level.
"Wow, looks like we are having a lot of spicy debates here.","I appreciate everyone's help, I'm in no position to be picky haha."

Well we wanna pay you a lot less if you don‚Äôt meet these,at this point i'm willing to work for room & board
"Sorry for being a possible dumbass but it says BS or MS in Comp Sci. Does that mean that you can major in Math or Physics during your undergraduate studies, complete a master's program in comp sci and still be able to compete with actual comp sci majors for a data science job?",I work with two ML Scientists who have PhDs in Physics and Chemistry
"If you‚Äôre graduating without at least two internships, you‚Äôre gonna have a tough time getting roles from people with an MS.",I got two internships and a MS. I've been job hunting in the UK for 2.5 months now üò¨
Get a job as SW engineer and pivot later,"I'm also applying to Software roles but I don't know too much about backend. So it'd be nice to get a Python/Quantitative developer role but there aren't too many in the UK. 

Thanks for the tip tho."
These posts are so annoying,"never thought it would get this popular, I want a job not karma :("
"Just stop complaining and apply. If no one meets a requirement, it's dropped, easy as that.",Complaining and applying are not mutually exclusive actions. I can apply and also keep complaining about unrealistic expectations.
Out of curiosity. I am currently doing my PHD and working in NLP on a scientific grant on the side. Will that qualify as equivalent to industry experience?,[deleted]
dont u have placement years in your degree lol,They don't do that for MS. But I guess I could go for one of the grad programs that pay <30k a year.
All of this nonsense so to can do ETL for someone's Tableau dashboard... I got pretty lucky with my journey into data science but seeing posts like this makes me annoyed for people who didn't totally luck out... I hope the unicorn job comes your way!,At this point I'm pretty ok with a donkey job
[deleted],"it says ""meaningful experience in industry"" üò¨"
"From a hiring manager (albeit not in data science): most job requirements may not preclude you from being a successful candidate. Unfortunately, when HR pre-vets candidates and you've selected 'no' on meets requirements, the hiring manager will never even see your resume. If you really feel like you're suited for a job that you don't have the requirements met, you may have to go a less traditional route (honestly I recommend this either way). Try finding out who the hiring manager is or at least someone on their team and have a conversation with them. Ask to send them your resume and they can get your application passed the automated vetting from HR. Also, I can say that this works from a job seeker's perspective. I have the opposite problem as you: plenty of experience, but no degree. Many job applications would have automatically ruled me out, but I got in early with the hiring manager or their team and they got me through to the interview stage.

You'll find yourself a job, just keep at it!","Side note: if during your time in school, you've done practical work in the industry for school projects, you can count that as well."
Senior Data Scientist here.  My rule of thumb is that if I hit 50% of the requirements I hit apply.   Also it is totally a numbers game.  Just spam out applications.  When I was looking for work I got about a 2 to 4 percent interview rate (I did no customization of my resume and used a generic cover letter).,"Thanks, that's great advice coming from an expert in the field ‚ù§Ô∏è

Same paradigm. Many people with the title, not many with the capabilities.

Many companies claiming they are doing data science. Not many companies actually doing data science.

"¬£38K for a data scientist isn't unreasonable and while it says pHd it's only as part of PhD/MSc/bsc, so any graduate would do.",It's very strange why they even bother putting PhD down as a qual when BSc is the minimum requirement.

"Yes I am so glad to have seen the 8046th version of this exact same kind of post. 

Love this subreddit!",How do I get my first job in data siens
"¬£38k really isn't outrageous at all if you're looking for an entry level DS in the UK, particularly if you're outside of London.

I think people's expectations are kind of blown out by the salries going around in a handful of US cities.

I don't think I'd ever consider offering a graduate > ¬£40k in the UK. There's absolutely no need to.","UK public sector junior DS in places such as Government Digital Service pull ¬£36k, and they have candidates with Oxford and Cambridge degrees (some PhDs) behind their belt + 1-2 years industry experience. I know someone from their HR so I'm not making this up."
This is the reality of the over abundance of candidates. People need a reality check that data scientists are no longer the rock stars they were in 2015...,"Who is upvoting this? I‚Äôm getting paid $300k as a data scientist second year out of my masters degree. 

Is the environment drastically different in Europe?"
"Ouch. I'm a Software Test Engineer currently (I automate testing for a living). I'm in the process of adding some data science to my repertoire and was thinking of a future career change due to the salary, and just because I might want a change of pace.

"Someone please talk about purchasing power parity or a big Mac index

2x the national living wage ($16.50) in the US is still only $33/hr which would definitely be on the very low side for a data scientist imo"
I would put a job description like that as a trap‚Ä¶ the candidates who apply to a job with a bunch of red flags likely didn‚Äôt read the description.,I‚Äôm gonna get vulnerable and ask a potentially stupid question. What are the red flags here? I‚Äôm a recent ds graduate currently job hunting and the jobs I‚Äôm applying to tend to have descriptions like this. Is it that they‚Äôre too vague?

USA salaries are often slightly better but your figures seem a bit off. Unless you exclusively looked to live in Westminster maybe.
Likelihood is that job needs to be posted before moving an internal candidate across teams or to be able to indicate job can't be filled to justify a foreign visa and is just a formality with no intent to find such a cheap candidate.

Results of my first data science job search. Some insight in the comments.,"I am an ABD PhD student who decided to transition into a data science-related position in industry. My field of study is heavy in statistics and optimization and I have 3 years of research experience in machine learning. I started applying for jobs on 4/21, primarily targeting Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer positions at non-MANGA companies. I accepted an offer yesterday. Here are some observations I had throughout the process that may be helpful for other job seekers:

\- I never got a single response from MANGA, even with referrals for several positions

\- I got several phone screens for positions which wanted 3+ years of industry experience, despite having 0. The recruiters for these positions seemed like they were having a hard time finding candidates, use this to your advantage.

\- Just mentioning that I had existing offers/other interviews scheduled to the recruiter would usually let me bypass stages of the interview process. Both of the offers I got resulted from this tactic. Don't be afraid to namedrop fancy companies, if you can.

\- The offer that I declined had a substantial on-call component to the job, but the job posting/recruiter NEVER mentioned this. If I hadn't specifically asked during a team fit call after the offer was made, they would have never told me. Be sure to ask lots of probing questions when you talk to the hiring manager/team you would join.

\- My communication was cited as one of the decisive factors leading to my offers. While technical skills are important, I got the impression that communication was highly valued at most of the companies I talked to. Don't neglect that skillset.

Edit: I wanted to clarify that I am NOT finishing my PhD. I am leaving the program after 3 years with only a masters degree."

[deleted],Haha I couldn't figure out how to fix that on Sankeymatic. There's just one slider for spacing. I was hoping I wouldn't get roasted for posting an ugly plot in the data science sub.
"I am right there with you, just with a few less phone screens and yet to find a job","Hang in there! It can definitely be demoralizing when you can't land the phone screens. I tried to find a position in March of last year and didn't land a single phone screen out of \~150 applications. If you haven't already, consider soliciting some feedback on your resume and trying to make some improvements there."
[deleted],"You've got it! If you're getting the phone screens but not progressing, it may be worth getting some interview practice at your university's career center. Best of luck!"
"This blows my mind about the take home assignments. Does anyone actually pass those? They seem to be made to reject EVERYONE. I have also done multiple, never got passed that. Crazy!",Just passed one I was expecting to bomb out of haha. I think the key is prioritising parts that are weighed more importantly: I‚Äôve never had enough time to finish the whole thing within the time limit (24hr in this case).
What about portfolio projects? Did you have a couple of them that stood out?,"I haven't done any projects specifically for my portfolio. I mostly relied on my research projects from grad school to showcase my abilities. I also shared my Github profile when applying (I have a Python package published on pip), but no one ever asked about it/commented on it."
No second or third interviews? That‚Äôs impressive.,"The processes at the companies I applied to generally looked like phone screen -> take home/online assessment -> 1-hr technical interview -> 1-day mega interview. I was able to bypass the 1-hr technical interview by pressuring the recruiter using my existing offer/other interviews. In one case, the company refused and I declined to continue with the process (since I wouldn't have been able to finish the loop before my offer expired)."

Where‚Äôs the insight in the comments,"Sorry, I was typing it up. It took a bit longer than anticipated to collect my thoughts."
"Maybe you guys are applying to too many. I mean 114? Are those really all jobs you want? My searches usually involve applying to like 4-8 positions.

A few well researched, high quality jobs where you're a good match and take the time to do some networking and write a good application might be better than blasting out 100 applications. You can't have deeply researched that many.","can you elaborate the *do some networking* part, especially when networking via LinkedIn has failed?

When I was in my home country, I don't even need to apply that much, less than 5 and I *always* got a job, but reality hit hard when I was abroad.

I sent \~320, only got 9 interviews, ended up with 8 rejections and 1 offer after 4 months. All of them were align with my qualifications, and yes I wanted all those jobs."
"I have seen a few of these posts and feel a bit bewildered by the sheer volume that is usually involved in peoples searches. I am a senior undergraduate in a data science major which was somewhat of a cross between biology and computer science / data science skills and am wondering how much these posts are the rule in the world of jobs with data science titles, and how much these are just exceptional cases which folks enjoy reporting upon? 

It seems absurd to do 100+ apps in my mind. Maybe there is no way to avoid that, but usually when I have applied to positions in the past (in different industries and at totally different skill levels) I get responses from just about everyone, and have a substantially higher ratio of offers to interviews, and generally just less unresponsiveness. 

Is it possible some folks are maybe taking a too-rapid-fire approach to this process? Or is it really going to look like this no matter how good you are at vetting good from bad options early on? 

Did you do a lot of specific tailoring of your resume or cover letter for these places you applied? Did you try and meet their specific language based criteria in whatever material of yours they see as a first look? 

I think I just want to understand how likely I am to be in a similar long search position post graduation and would appreciate any perspective others can offer. 

Thanks for the post btw OP.","Glad you got some value out of the post!

In regards to the large # of applications, you should check out other folks' job search results for entry level positions. There are lots of them on Reddit, and many involve similar numbers regardless of the field. That said, data science is a highly sought-after career right now and I get the impression that the applicant pool skews heavily towards new grads. This makes for fierce competition for entry level positions. Meanwhile companies are desperate for experienced data scientists.

I did a job search in March-April of last year and didn't land a single phone screen out of \~150 applications. For that job search, I was tailoring my resume to each posting and writing cover letters for each one. It was a huge time sink and left me massively discouraged. 

This time I just rapid fired my resume. The only tailoring I did was by the job type: I had one resume for MLE and one for data scientist. I used ZipRecruiter one-click applies, LinkedIn EasyApply, whatever was the fastest way to get my resume into the system. If there was a requirement for a cover letter or they didn't have automatic resume parsing, I didn't apply.

I think the rapid-fire approach will yield better results if you strictly applying through online job postings, simply because whether or not you make it through the automatic resume filter is basically random. The probability of making it through the filter is an increasing function of your resume quality. Once you've optimized your resume, the only thing left to do is have enough applications that you start getting hits.

Is it a lot of jobs to apply for? Yes, but it didn't actually take that much time. I spent a few hours updating my resumes and then it only took \~30 min per day to look through the newest postings on job boards and apply to the relevant ones. The entire job search from first application to offer accepted took slightly more than a month, which by most standards would be considered pretty fast."
"Does 5 ""decline to continue"" = rejected?

Or does it mean that you declined to from your perspective, as in you didn't want to go futher into the interview process?","It means I was given the option to continue in the process but chose not to. I had some phone screens where I felt there wasn't a good fit or the compensation wasn't competitive. I also was in the pipeline with a few companies when I got the offer I really wanted, so I declined to continue at that time."

I think the laser focus on modelling in data science communities is frankly bizarre. Some people seem to have the impression that if you aren't using machine learning tools somehow it isn't really data science.

I have a very hard time relating to this attitude. Model training is a chore, it's very rarely the interesting part of a problem. All of the joy comes in experimental design, figuring out interesting ways of measuring something and coming to a better understanding of a process (sometimes involving building a model!)."

"It is also important to understand what that ""science"" thing means.  It means is applying the scientific method to improve understanding.

The steps to the Scientific Method are:

1) Pose a Testable Question.  
2) Conduct Background Research.  
3) State your Hypothesis.  
4) Design Experiment.  
5) Perform your Experiment.  
6) Collect Data.  
7) Draw Conclusions.  
8) Publish Findings (optional).

You also are NOT trying to prove the hypothesis.  Let the facts speak for themselves and getting a clear example that invalidates a hypothesis is a powerful way to improve understanding.","Since most data science is not done in academia, I think step 8 should be more sharing your findings with coworkers (or testers/auditors if you have them) and asking them to poke holes in your methodology and conclusions in a way similar to how publishing does with journals. This is especially important with regards to Simpson's paradox and finding the true causation rather than finding simple correlations. Peer review and criticism is one of the most important parts of the scientific method."
"Agree in part, but most of the analytics problems that people are faced with don't require sophisticated modeling techniques or advanced stats knowledge, or even advanced database knowledge. The vast majority of business problems and ""insights"" can be garnered from merging/joining disparate data, cleaning that data, and filtering/sorting afterward to answer specific questions.

There's a lot of overkill in trying to fix relatively simple problems with overly complex methods and tools, because business leaders and managers don't really know how to address the issues with the analytics resources they have. Newer analytics professionals have been taught all this theory and their applied knowledge stems from having nice and neat use cases with perfect data, the right tools to use, and clearly defined objects ... which is hardly how things work in the real world.","Hard agree.  I expect in a utopian environment, 80% of ""success"" comes from the boring parts (execution, discipline, people just ""do(ing) your job""... tm New England Patriots) and maybe 20% from fun stuff (non-basic analytics etc.)"
It‚Äôs almost as if statistics and software engineering are much clearer terms which should be used instead of data science.,Meh I might be in the minority here but I enjoy the fact that they've gotten blended a bit together. For some projects you do need a true statistician and/or true software engineer. But for a lot of projects I'd prefer to have people who can do both at a moderate level rather than having separate people to analyze the data and build the tools.
"Do you (or anyone) recommend a path to start mastering that ""science"" part? Assuming whatever you think are the minimum educational requirements.","Just about anything in the realm of statistics that isn't glamourous in data science at the moment. Design of experiments, sampling theory, inferential statistics, instrument validation, etc. A textbook for research methods in social sciences would probably be a good primer, even if it doesn't go into great technical depth.

Imagine, for example, that you want to assess the quality of a questionnaire or survey that's being given to users of a product. How do you determine if each scale is measuring one construct, if some items are redundant, if the items are properly discriminating between groups of users, or if some questions are of a poor quality (or if people are randomly answering)? Psychometricians use frameworks like Item Response Theory to answer questions like these. IRT is not hard to get up and running with, but I couldn't tell you if anyone is bothering to assess the quality of the instruments they use to collect data."
"I agree with this statement.

I think the challenge I have with anything data science related in my career development is related to science. Specifically,

- How can I motivate scientific thinking in my career when all of my clients and companies are more interested in results? Oftentimes I‚Äôm tasked to do something as a data scientist where my only responsibility is to build a monitoring dashboard primarily for convenience sake and not for any strong scientific reasons that would improve the business. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs just due to company politics, or if I‚Äôm not in the part of my career where I‚Äôm senior enough to dive into these problems.

- How can I show scientific thinking on my resume? How can I gauge scientific thinking in interviews? I think this can partially be addressed by building a portfolio to document the analytical approach I designed for any starting problems but companies seem to only care about what they can get out of data science vs. the whys in data science. They also just don‚Äôt care about the portfolio because work experience is more important. I can build a dashboard with the ideal technical architecture but I wouldn‚Äôt know how I can show the value of choose technical design decision A vs B. 

These two points make me very confused in figuring out the best strategy to move forward in my data science career. I am a pure mathematician in training, and it‚Äôs been frustrating (still is) to really not use the scientific thinking I wanted to bring in my data science career due to factors completely out of my control.

"I work with two types of data scientists: physical science PhDs with ~10 years of industry experience and whip-smart junior coders with more of a CS background.

The old-school data scientists come up with the most creative approaches. They approach each problem differently, they take the time in understanding the data and its limitations before working their way up to building a model. Their models might not be terribly exciting, but they can explain every last detail of theory behind the model and why it's appropriate.

Conversely, most of the junior data scientists want to turn around as many models as possible in as short a time as they can. Every problem they're given ends up shoved in to an xgboost or scikit-learn model within hours of getting their hands on the data. They program functions to test many different types of models and then evaluate the performance to pick a ""winner."" When they're given a forecasting project, they focus their whole document praising prophet and then processing the data wholesale.

There's a middle ground. The old-school guys sneer at terms like AI and ML. The younger set takes data at face value and treats xgboost like a data science panacea. 

It's important not to completely close yourself off from some of the more ""turnkey"" packages and libraries that are becoming available, but it's **far** more important to be intellectually curious about how they work and what they're actually doing with your data.","Yeah our company has one team that develops the models, mostly old school data scientists, and the team that puts them in production, my team, which is mostly people with more tech skills. My role is sort of in communicating between the teams so when the model developer uses data that isn't available in production I need to explain to them what's available and when imputing will work or not (if the most important right-hand variable is a-b and we have to impute b based on a in production, you're going to have a bad time). 

But then on the other side more junior members of my team will just have no curiosity whatsoever and will just code what's assigned to them and when asked about a model output difference will respond with giant datasets and/or programming lingo. That's kind of what prompted this post. Part of my job is to also mentor our junior analysts and get them asking the right questions and developing that curiosity. It's hard though. I keep trying to stress empathy with the business. If you tell the business variable x is different and here's an excel dump they're not going to gain anything. If however you can explain how variable x is derived, what the business importance is, and the general trend that's contributing to x changing, there's your value."
"Well said! It seems that fundamental statistics are being omitted from the practice of DS.

I equate the ""science"" of data science to be analogous to statistics.

The other week I reviewed a presentation in which the experiment resulted in a p-value equal to 0.1. Apparently, it's common practice at my employer to say that it is ""leaning towards being statistically significant"".

All setbacks of p-value aside, how can DS be accurately applied if we exclude its backbone, i.e. statistics? Also, it seems that many companies ignore basics of experiments in design/implementation.","I've been worried about this too. I have a PhD, did years of research, and cut my teeth on building custom statistical models for my research topics. My background really is in custom statistical solutions to various data problems. Understanding statistical theory, stats modeling, measurement theory, joint probability models, etc are critical imo. They're also \*incredibly\* useful, yet underutilized broadly across DS.

I love my job, and my team /is/ full of people with statistical literacy, who see the value and necessity of statistical theory in the DS pipeline. It is \*startling\* to me how many DS teams have little to \*no\* statistical training. How can you plan a proper study? How do you handle low-N aggregates? How do you adjust for known and unknown missings when delivering data to clients? How do you handle unknown subgrouping combinations without some form of probability modeling? How do you impose a certain functional form in a principled way? How do you manage the very noisy measurements that companies deal with? There's just so much that /should/ be core to the whole DS pipeline that requires some form of statistical literacy. It changes how you approach problems, what data you deem relevant (or irrelevant), the dangers of certain decisions down the pipeline, etc. It is actually hard for me to understand, from my history, how people in DS actually get by and make decisions without that skill set. For me personally, my statistical skillset impacts everything I do in the entire DS product pipeline.

Sorry for the long reply - It's been on my mind a lot this week. I love the problem solving in DS; I love being able to improve predictions, estimates, decisions, etc, for clients and products using some domain knowledge and a fairly hefty amount of stats experience. Really fun stuff honestly. But I worry about what the future of DS will look like, with how scarce that skill set seems to be. I suspect the job role titles in DS will become more specific (which is good, because DS means both everything and nothing at the same time), but I want the future of DS, broadly, to value the statistical side at least as much as it values the tooling and infrastructure. It's got really good stuff and improves how you think about your problem/data/question."
Im an newbie in this field. What do you guys think what are the most fundamental things that most data scientist neglect that removes the science out of data science? I‚Äôm currently taking statistical inference courses on coursera and I am still having a hard time wrapping my head about p-values.,"> What do you guys think what are the most fundamental things that most data scientist neglect that removes the science out of data science?

Statistics. Statistics. And statistics. One course won't get you there either btw. One key concept is understanding the assumptions of your model. A lot of people don't even recognize that their models are making assumptions, let alone analyze them. The way you model creates certain biases and assumptions. The data you use has certain biases and makes certain assumptions (e.g. maybe you assume no black swans). You should continuously be doubting your model and your data. It's fine to use imperfect models, but you need to understand how and why they fail."
"r/dataisbeautiful is a parody sub as far as I can tell. Every single post that makes it to the top has at least one major problem with interpretability. It‚Äôs excellent for examples of how not to present data.

I‚Äôm very much with you though. The science part is very important and rarely taught.","Well r/dataisbeautiful is not really about what the data is saying, but rather about how can we visualize it in a cool and unique way. Is the data relevant is an other story then. Sure a metric ton of top-posts are with unusable data, but it is shown in a cool and unique way

(ok... now we only have raceplots and stupid piecharts but sometime a cool one emerges... sometimes... but this is an other topic)"
"tbh in the real world, using and optimizing tool usage is a much higher productivity increase than optimizing the science.

Nowadays, building a model is much easier than actually deploying it to production.","In this context I'd say the science part is building a good model. That includes looking for which data to measure and collect, the ability to come up with the idea of using a data-driven model to solve the business problem, establishing a hypothesis, figuring out true causation upon having data.

I'll give a good example at a previous job. We wanted to estimate how much a house would sell for, and we had pretty meh data in terms of important variables. But on paper we constructed a very predictive model, the #1 predictive variable was the list price. This model was in production before my manager said wait a minute, the true driver of house price isn't actually listing price, otherwise people could always sell their crappy house by just listing it higher. We ended up going through a vendor and purchasing mls data that included hundreds of fields. We then were able to construct a model that had what we thought were better predictors of how much the house would sell for. 

And it wasn't as predictive as the previous one, and we determined that actually since people selling houses didn't have an incentive to have our model spit out a higher predicted price, we were fine with the old model. But we knew that we were actually modeling based on seller behavior, we had researched alternatives, and were comfortable making what we thought was a correct decision to have the right hand side variable be what the seller listed the house at. We also know what we need to monitor for potential model deterioration.

Is getting a model into production a walk in the park? Not at all, but I'd argue that people who can work through the previous problem are rarer and more valuable than people who can put a model into production."
"No. Science is about reproducibility and the ability to falsify hypotheses.

Soft skills help, but they help in every field.

Data Science in general is terrible at reproducibility because tools like jupyter notebook don't allow it (because cells can be executed in arbitrary order and displayed results could rely on deleted state), and it's a mission to get data scientists to use version control for code, let alone data.

Tools matter 100% to ensuring the science part is carried out correctly.","Data science isn't by definition irreproducible. What you're describing is just terrible data science. It's perfectly possible to have a reproducible jupyter notebook if you're paying attention for five minutes and not doing silly things.

I agree reproducibility is key for good science but I'd really make that distinction between good and bad science rather than automatically binning DS in ""bad"". I mean professionals in the hard sciences use jupyter notebooks all the time."
"Unpopular opinion: 

My view and experience in the business world has some similarities as yours, with my conclusions being very different. Data Science is the act and art of applying scientific algorithms and methods to data in depths and time frames impossible to humans. Each company defines the scope and definition of business success. Value propositions for company and customer are almost always equal. Citizen and junior data scientists are quick to apply the next shiny framework, algorithm, library or technique in their attempts to find success without having to use the scientific method to study the data and solve thoughtful problems. Conflict in quality commonly comes from the company when they want to announce some new buzzword in production, and when they are willing to accept poor quality for the sake of Sales/Marketing. Shiny frameworks and libraries are applied half hazardly, data is poorly understood, and poor results updated on next release. The academic nature of senior data scientists shunned. These conflicts will continue to erode the field as it relates to the business world. 

I agree that data scientists need to speak to customer value in a way that the customer stakeholder is able to see rubber-hitting-the-road value. This is an under appreciated but supremely superior skill. One that should be a primary skill set of a senior scientist. Value created needs to be equally value communicated in the customers on terms. 

Lastly I would suggest that data scientists need to be less academy and more application. A common ratio of R&D at mature companies is 80% application of science and 20% research. Most data scientists I know and have worked with would do themselves and their profession a great service by practicing applied data science and save the academics for their off time.

Edit 1: on mobile, spell check bit me. I meant ‚Äòapplied‚Äô vs ‚Äòapplication‚Äô in the manner of ‚Äòapplied mathematics‚Äô rather than theoretical. Apologies for any confusion.","I think you misunderstood what I meant. When you do ""application"", how do you approach what you're doing? Do you have a boss who tells you exactly what functions to code? Or do you use critical thinking and problem-solving capability to figure out how to best solve the business problem? Have you ever had someone think you should do x and you pointed out that y would be more efficient and solve the problem better?

As an example, we recently acquired another company and were working to integrate their data into our production models. Many people took their job as a simple mapping exercise and didn't think about which variables were used in the models, which imputations would cause issues, how the imputations would impact calculated model variables, etc. This project would almost definitely be counted as application, but there's a lot of science and critical thinking involved that many people in the industry don't do."

"This is oversimplified because I don't remember all of the details (almost two decades ago).

Worked for a company that provided Hollywood with projections for how their movies were going to perform. However, different movies would perform differently in different areas. For example, G-rated movies would perform better in small towns, while ""gansta"" movies would perform better in big cities.

Thus, on the projections interface, we would give someone a ""weight"" factor that they would learn to adjust over time, depending on where the movies were shown, and what types of movies they were showing.

The default ""weight"" was 14. Hollywood executives would bump that up or down based on their understanding of it (we worked very hard to keep this dead simple because you can't explain the complexities of this to Hollywood execs).

So we had a developer who worked for six months to overhaul all of our prediction models, because they were OK, but not good enough.

After six months of work, he released his new model, with new weight adjustments for every theater across the US, and the default ""weight"" was changed slightly.

Hollywood execs were furious, accusing us of ""fudging"" the numbers, even though we couldn't figure out how we could ""fudge"" predictions of future sales.

The developer and I went into a meeting with a vice president and the veep explained the political situation. The developer, however, then spent half an hour at a white board explaining the intricacies of the statistical model and why the default weight had to be lowered.

The white board was covered with equations. It was covered with hand-drawn graphs. The developer went on and on and on and after half an hour, the veep‚Äîwhose eyes had glazed over‚Äîjust said ""yeah, but change the default weight back.""

Eventually, even though our numbers were more accurate, we had to throw out the entire project because:

1. Hollywood execs adjusting those weights would see different results from before
2. No one could understand the complexity of the new system

It was a painful, expensive exercise in egos versus math.

And let's not get me started on how many times I've heard ""experts"" say that A/B test results had to be wrong because they didn't match what the experts knew.",Seems like the analysts had no clue how the model was used.
Did you try a random forest or some deep learning though? ^/s,Did you try SageMaker though?

"It exactly captures the difference between good ol' statistical modeling and machine learning.

The nature of computational thinking is that you invent a way to check the result and then shake the box until the result looks approximately right and there it is. Because implementing box shaking is easy and you can just shake the box really fast, it's a valid approach to solve problems.

How to check the result is the complex part with no ""one right way"" to do it and the reason you get paid 120k. It's also use-case specific due to ""no free lunch"" theorem.

So the whole focus on ML research is more effective and different box shaking mechanisms and what is left for the practitioner is to figure out how to pour things in the box and how to interpret what comes out.

In contrast, the field of statistics is focused on carefully crafted recipes which is pretty much a manual process and doesn't scale well when you need a new recipe every hour to keep up with the newest trends of millenials but works fairly well when whatever you're trying to model is not too complicated and doesn't change regularly.",This is actually a very good answer.

OP: Please add source.","Let's be fair, since there's even a xkcd style for matplotlib, I think pretty much everyone that's come to this thread knows the picture is from xkcd. That's not to say you shouldn't include source, just it's understandable that one might forget. It's like talking about data science to someone that is interested in it and not explaining what regression is - generally people already know."
Seriously how I feel about all the winners on kaggle.,I would say almost all Kaggle
"I'm grateful that my managers are technical. They don't encourage this kind of ""data science""","My direct supervisor is not only non-technical but I feel like he actively tries to not learn even the very basics.

As long as your way to validate the answers is correct you can stir as much as you want.,[deleted]
[deleted],Depends on where you work.
I found a research paper that is almost entirely my copied-and-pasted Kaggle work?,"Send an email to the editor of the journal. Include all evidence you have. CC the department heads and deans at the university(s) where the authors of this paper work. This is academic fraud and it is generally taken very seriously.

EDIT: as others mentioned below, looks like it's a pre-print.  All authors use a gmail address, except the lead. The upload occured from one of the authors with a gmail address.  Searching on LinkedIn the lead is a university instructor. Makes me wonder if this was student project she advised and was unaware of the plagiarism.   In that case, I suppose I might start by reaching out to the lead author on  LinkedIn or via email and see how far that gets you. Next step would be to reach out to the university (dept head and dean)."

"Holy shit they aren't even trying to hide it. Looks like the ""research paper"" is just a preprint, and it definitely won't be getting published in any reputable journal.

I don't think there's much you can do since they're not in the U.S. and this hasn't been published. You can report their work to ResearchGate to try to get it taken down ([https://www.researchgate.net/ip-policy](https://www.researchgate.net/ip-policy)). You could also try contacting the university or one of the researchers. There's a chance this is one of the researcher's thesis/project and the other ""collaborators"" are just supervisors that don't know it's plagiarized. However, as another commenter said, other countries have higher tolerance for plagiarism.",This is not true. Academia treats this very seriously. You need to make a huge fuss about this in researchgate and at the university level and you‚Äôll get what you wanted.
"Don't worry too much about it, as others have pointed out, its only a pre-print.

Also, looking at the references cited,

* \[9\] Kaggle project
* \[11\] some stats course
* \[13\] data science central article
* \[14\] R package reference

Its clear these people are **VERY** far away from researchers and I can safely say that no serious academic will ever cite/read their work.

**Edit:** I see some comments that this is bad advice and something should be done.. In my view, I don't see what OP could reasonably expect other than a takedown and a half-hearted apology (a citation is not possible for wholesale copy pasting). To me that does not accomplish much, other than a slight sense of satisfaction and hours fretting over it. The authors are likely going to continue copying others anyway..","What even is this paper? Subchapters from 1 to 22. Random gray font. Images that disappear at the bottom of the page. Captions overlaying the figures. Heavily condensed plots, so that the axes are no longer readable. Terrible image resolutions. Strange spacing.
This honestly looks like some bot tried to automatically scrape some content from Kaggle."
"I‚Äôm sure this is covered by the other comments but you ***NEED*** to do something about this.

A) contact the university/faculty that presided over that research. The grad student will likely include their faculty advisor on the paper, so it should be easy to see as well.

B) regardless of them copy+pasting it and giving creditor not, that fraud of a student (I‚Äôm assuming) out there is likely advancing his degree off your work. Especially if it‚Äôs copy + pasted qualitative findings/analysis, not just the data/results. No different that intellectual theft at that point.

Go prevent that schmuck from bringing the field down.

TL;DR this is an important issue. Go nail the sucker by contacting the university department head.",100% this
"This happens to me once- I was a PhD student and one of my paper was copy pasted. I discussed this with my academic advisor and we decided to go with this approach:
1. Email to the lead in the paper and tell him that this is obviously plagiarism and if not retracted, you will notify the university and the journal.
2. Give them 2 weeks to reply or remove the paper.
3. If they didn‚Äôt, send a mail to the department head and the journal editor- plagiarism is a serious issue.

We decided to go this way just to give the benefit of doubt to the professor in the paper. He or she may not be aware of it. So it‚Äôs better to give him a chance :)

Good luck",What happened? Did they retract it?
They didn't even change colors on the figures. I would email the journal editors.,it isn't going to any journal
"Good day!

"I didn‚Äôt read though it all, but certainly seems sus.  Did the papers authors use the same public dataset you used?",The charts are identical. Pretty obvious sign that there was fraud.
"This almost reads like an experiment in writing code to scrape kaggle projects, run the results through GPT3, and turn it into something that looks vaguely like a real research paper. Worse: it's almost certainly not that (writing that code would have been hard, and there's no way they're up to it). Someone probably just copied your work and did a really, really poor job of writing it up. 

I'm not quite sure what these people gain from putting crap like this out into the world. I think the logic is that no one's ever going to verify papers beyond googling to see if they exist, so even if it's complete garbage it still gets them a resume line and if they string together a couple of these it might trick someone into believing that they're competent? 

Anyways, any place that was willing to hire these idiots isn't going to care about their laziness and stupidity. Throwing their names and the article name into the world in a blog post demonstrating clear evidence of plagiarism couldn't hurt though. Then if anyone randomly googles this article or them, they'll get your post too.",">I'm not quite sure what these people gain from putting crap like this out into the world.

Besides possibly getting academic credit a degree? They gain a lot.

Employers don't check to see if your portfolio is original work or if you're just copying from other people.

People get jobs based on this kind of fraud. When it turns out that they can't do the work themselves, they turn to freelance sites to pay people peanuts to do work for them, and pass it on to their employer. Rinse and repeat.

If you're sharing your original work, the only thing you can really do to fight back is to have a section on your site where you link to fraudulent work. At least it shows up in search engines and increases the chance of people seeing it as fraudulent. Why is this project showing up on two different websites? Oh, because it's plagiarized from this other person."

"This is my punchline in this subreddit: **start working at places that put data first**. Some companies have data as their main product, be there.","Well put. I spent just two months in customer analytics at a major retailer and all aspects of their data workflows were a disaster.

Data Science interviews these days,"I just had an interview that went like this:

1. Recruiter screen
2. Live SQL (30mins)
3. Live Python (45mins)
4. Hiring Manager (behavioral) (30mins)
5. Live Data Exploration (1 hour)
6. Live Modelling (1 hour)
7. Stats case study (30min)
8. Product Manager behavioral (30mins)
9. Other PM behavioral (30mins)
10. Hiring Manager catchup (30mins)

5-10 were on the same day as part of the ‚Äúsuper day‚Äù.

The live data exploration was the fucking dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever done. Giving me a dataset that I‚Äôm not a domain expert on, not related to the role, and asking me question without letting me actually explore the data first. Should have been a fuxking take home.

The live modeling is also stupid, but I was well prepared for it so that went well. But I‚Äôm still so bitter about that data exploration interview."

I don‚Äôt know if this means I‚Äôm not a good candidate but all my successful job interviews have been about 30-45 mins and all my unsuccessful ones have been these day long interviews.,you lack the stamina necessary for late stage capitalism
"If this doesn‚Äôt demonstrate an excess supply of data scientists, idk what does. Companies can afford to be picky when tons of people want the job",I doubt this will enable a company to pick the best...
You guys are getting interviews?,"I've been applying on and off for a few months now as an MLE with 4.5 YOE, but only when I see jobs that really interest me.

I got my current job in 2022, and I'd get an interview for maybe 30% of the applications I sent out. Haven't had a single interview this year."
I genuinely stopped doing data science because I was being asked to do more work during the interview process just to get ghosted.,I‚Äôm willing to do a take home that takes no more than an hour. Anything more than that is an automatically no.
I've never had reference checks,I recently had a recruiter ask for references just to submit me to interview for a contract role. I was like lol no. I have a permanent job right now so it definitely wasn‚Äôt worth the hassle.
"I went through 10 rounds of interviews for a role only to get rejected because they said and I quote: it was a split decision with one interview not going your way. That's all it takes, one 30 minute interview to be sub-par to get rejected.


Screening rounds:

1. Recruiter screen (30 mins)
2. Hiring Manager screen (30 mins)
3. Live SQL (30 mins)
4. Live case study (30 mins)

On Site Rounds:


5. XFN Partner 1 (30 mins)

6. XFN Partner 2 (30 mins)

7. System Design (45 mins)

8. Product Leadership (45 mins)

9. People Leadership (45 mins)

10. Experiment design + discussion (45 mins)

Every other role I've interviewed for seems to have anywhere from 4 to 6 rounds total with:

1. Recruiter screen
2. Hiring manager / technical screen
3. 2-4 rounds of on-site interviews in one day with a mix of technical, behavioral, and cross-functional","> I went through 10 rounds of interviews for a role only to get rejected because they said and I quote: it was a split decision with one interview not going your way. That's all it takes, one 30 minute interview to be sub-par to get rejected.

As someone who has been in those rooms when hiring decision. It is very very very likely you werent rejected because ""one 30 minute interview to be sub-par"" but because the person who got the role had all their interviews go well and there was only 1 open role. The only cases I have seen rejection based on 1 interview is where that candidate absolutely did way more than be ""sub-par"".

Interviews are a competitive process."
"me when i interviewed at a small-ish manufacturing company who wanted to hire their first ds:

1. 30 min phone interview with HR
2. 2 hour in person interview with hiring managers and other candidates (we weren't even candidates for the same role, so i was meeting with managers and candidates that had zero relevance to the role)
3. 2 hour in person interview with more hiring managers (though specific to me this time) and i had to make an ""about me"" presentation with why i was a good fit for the role (like, just look at my cv/linkedin/personal website, no?)
4. 4 day ""business simulation"" where i started from literal ground zero with a random dataset they gave me and was told to give them industry insights (despite not being familiar with the industry previously and having no knowledge of the company's history etc.)... i would have MUCH rather had a tech interview and been over and done. because they put me on a clock i had a hard time knowing where to begin or who to talk to and didn't get to familiarise myself very well with their data or what all the fields meant etc.
5. 2 hour presentation and debrief (i had nothing to really present on because i didn't have much beyond EDA and general ""here are trends happening in the industry and how they might effect the company""... then got panel grilled and they complained i didn't work on how they could integrate AI tools when they never said anything about AI except ""know how to use it"" and i used chatGPT for a summary???)

honestly the most overkill experience for a manufacturing firm that required every day in office, had no previous ds infrastructure or people knowledgeable about it, and would've paid $70k at most. they basically wanted an all-in-one wizard to do the job of 2 people in 1.",Maybe these long interview processes happen in smaller companies starting out in data science? Why was this even happening to you lol.
"This really is absurd.

Edit:

My ideal interview is the following.

Manager Review 1 Hour
Talk through Behavioral Interview 
Tell me about a time‚Ä¶

Compressed Technical:
Here is a hypothetical business problem we have, here is the associated data‚Ä¶ walk me through your approach‚Ä¶ 


2. Culture Fit and Deeper Technical  with Team 1 Hour 
Team Behavioral and how you worked with your team 

Take a deeper Dive into Technical 
I have a set of data and a model, what metrics would I use here.",Lmao - what? Its absolutely not.
"Kinda the reason Im trying to fast track to be in a management role at smaller companies.¬†


Ive interviewed for a few director or senior manager roles now and its usually 2-3 interview rounds maximum. They dont spend months and momths on technicals either","Yep, nobody hates nerds like other nerds. At least management treat their own pretty decently."
5 final interview rounds I think is too many. But before that it looks alright,"Does it? Isn't that the typical layout of an on-site interview, back when those were in-person?

Usually 3 technical interviews (Coding, SQL, ML Case Study), 1 HM interview (Behavioral), and then a final interview with a VP/Founder that's more of a sales call than a real interview."
"I‚Äôve really only experienced these kinds of rounds in tech company interviews (from Google to Meta and OpenAI), and it‚Äôs not really abnormal.",Same.
"I had a similar number of rounds. Emailed the recruiter that I won‚Äôt be doing any 4/5 hour programming assignments. They said it was a mandatory part of the hiring process. Thanked for the opportunity and moved on. We should be collectively declining these types of hiring processes. 

I have lawyer and doctor friends that only had 2 rounds.","Your lawyer and doctor friends have advanced degrees, professional exams, and licences that help to validate their qualifications."
"I'm vehemently against absurd interview processes - but this is completely appropriate. 2 quick screenings - followed by 2.5hr interview. 

You're talking about a data science role here. Thats not an entry level job, its a difficult position that will likely cost the company a good chunk of money - they need to do their due diligence.

This sub just expects jobs to be handed out like freaking Oprah Winfrey.

FWIW - the interview process that I mostly established for my org (F500 company) is almost identical:

* Recruiter Screen (15-30 min)

* Manager Screen (15-20 min)

* Take home assignment (pretty simple dataset that has some nuance and complexity) - we ask they spend less than 1 hour and provide their code during the main interview.

* main interview 1.5-2 hours: first 15 is talking about role, company, team, etc..., 15 of them talking through resume and about themselves...20-30 talk through the code they provided with our principal DS. ~45 min behavioral based conducted by manager(s) and sometimes a more senior IC. ~30 min open Q&A (both ways).

* final intervew 30 min with myself: This is a really casual meet and greet. At this point my managers have made their decision - if you're at this stage its mostly just so I'm comfortable giving the final sign off. You would have to really mess up to get cut at this point (happened 1 time ever).

I belive this is completely reasonable given that I may be paying someone 100s of thousands of dollars a year.

Edit: only thing that I take issue with here is the references - we validate that people worked where they say they did/went to school where they say...but I would never call for a personal reference.",">¬†This sub just expects jobs to be handed out like freaking Oprah Winfrey.

No, it‚Äôs just that no one wants to have to take multiple vacation days to do interviews along with all the take home assignments. The worst is when you actually jump through the hoops and the offer is just meh.¬†"
"So 3.5 hours.

Honest question to you people who post these interview complaints every day on this sub: How long do you want the interview process to be? Would you honestly feel comfortable joining a company that you only had 30 minutes to an hour of contact with?",Exactly.
is it faang or what? is it normal to lead a candidate through so many steps? damn bureaucracy,nah man. tbh I never hear of this company. Its a mid-tier company.
"The time needed for item 4 seems a bit excessive unless it's for a leadership position, a good interviewer should be able to cover all of that in 45 minutes to an hour.¬† Also I don't know why a founder interview is needed, unless it's for a principal data scientist or management role. Otherwise it looks reasonable though.",My last 3 interviews for a mid-level DSand mid-level MLE reached an interview with cto and ceo.
And mfs still have the gall to reject after clearing all but the last round,"Why do the last round if it can't change the result?


You aren't the only candidate. When it gets to the later stages, it's not so much that they rejected you as it is that they preferred someone else.¬†"
USA?,"Wait, it's not like this in other countries? What do interviews in other countries look like?"
"Guys quick question, is java important in 2024 or future?","There's a lot of legacy code at large companies written in Java, so you'll probably never starve if you're an experienced Java dev, but if you're just starting out in 2024 I think you should focus on Ligma."
"If you are in Asia Pacific good luck, I had a Chinese test even before the technical test. For big tech btw

Context: The emerging market is China, so I have to understand the domain in Chinese too",What do you mean a Chinese test?
I literally had 6 interviews,"hope u got the offer. I gave 5 rounds across 4 weeks, the position is on hold now. :/"
"Seems pretty reasonable, especially if 4 is scheduled in one day (like an ‚Äúin-person‚Äù final round).

Also depends on how involved 3 is. I really fucking hate open-ended take homes. Who‚Äôs got time for that?","I'd rather do a take home than Leetcode, but that's just me. Even if you don't get the job, you can likely add it to your GitHub.


That said, if it looks like the company is trying to get free consulting I'll tell them to kick bricks."
"If its a six figure job. I honestly dont see the issue and would understand for most companies requisitioning the budget for a six figure role is big deal so yeah they would want to be sure.

Also I do understand that back in the day and in the present you could get six figure jobs on the basis of a firm handshake and a can do attitude but the reality of that was an ‚Äúold boys network‚Äù where people hired people they were referred or were personally known. A situation where for most of the people complaining about the long interview process would be excluded anyways.","> If its a six figure job. I honestly dont see the issue and would understand for most companies requisitioning the budget for a six figure role is big deal so yeah they would want to be sure.

six figures isn't what it used to be.   I've seen fresh college grads breaking that barrier on entry level gigs."
"Hello everyone,I recently switched to Datascience  before this I was a software dev(mobile app developer).I later went into the business side of it, so I wasn't actively coding. I grew a great interest in Datascience, and I wanted to become a Data consultant finance being my niche. I have so far acquitted myself with basics of ML done projects both on Superviced and Unsupervised learning proceeded into PowerBi,excel and Sql later on proceeded into Deep learning (ANN,CNN,RNN,transfer learning,gradient descent,regularization etc) tried to familiarize myself with most of the concepts so that in future should I need to use them they won't sound so foreign, I have studied a little bit about big data technologies(Pyspark,HadoopMapreduce).Now since I don't want to get stuck in the loop of learning how do I proceed for context I dedicated a whole year to learning this and yes I have put my knowledge to practice (I have tutored a number of people both of DS and DataAnalytics) but still I feel like I am not that good, I haven't found a better way to practice and finding a job has been so hard","Try to figure out what you want to focus on. If you want to learn techniques/methods your data should be cleaner to focus on the skills you want to learn. Solve real world problems or do kaggle. 

While I do the same thing in that you go from one cool problem to the next it's probably better to get decent at one method/problem set. Pick a focus area of problems and try to get good at that. There are two ways one is to go for flavor of the month/year which is genai or go for what things interest you."
